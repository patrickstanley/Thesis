abstract = {The processing of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) often involves co-sintering of multi-layered stacks. In the case of SOFCs incorporating Ni-based anodes, hydrogen reduction of the anode usually takes place during the first service cycle of operation or conditioning. Initial reduction causes changes in the chemistry, microstructure and properties of the Ni-based anode material, which in turn induce mechanical stresses in the cell. In this study the elastic moduli, biaxial strength and fracture toughness of unreduced (NiO-YSZ) and reduced (Ni-YSZ) anode were determined as functions of porosity. Elastic properties were determined by impulse excitation at ambient temperature. Biaxial strength and fracture toughness were determined at ambient temperature by the ring-on-ring and double torsion test methods, respectively. It was found that the mechanical properties of unreduced and reduced Ni-based anode materials depend strongly on porosity. Property-porosity trends were found to be in good agreement with prediction of the minimum solid area model. Results presented in this study show that the elastic moduli and biaxial strength of the Ni-based anode material decreases after reduction in hydrogen while fracture toughness increases after reduction due to formation of ductile Ni-metal phase.

abstract = {Fuel cells offer the possibility of zero-emissions electricity generation and increased energy security. We review here the current status of solid oxide (SOFC) and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMFC) fuel cells. Such solid electrolyte systems obviate the need to contain corrosive liquids and are thus preferred by many developers over alkali, phosphoric acid or molten carbonate fuel cells. Dramatic improvements in power densities have been achieved in both SOFC and PEMFC systems through reduction of the electrolyte thickness and architectural control of the composite electrodes. Current efforts are aimed at reducing SOFC costs by lowering operating temperatures to 500-800 ??C, and reducing PEMFC system complexity be developing 'water-free' membranes which can also be operated at temperatures slightly above 100 ??C. ?? 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {Hydrogen reduction of porous bulk NiO particles has been studied with in situ hot-stage X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the temperature range175–300 ◦C. This technique has the ability to measureNiOdisappearance andNiappearance simultaneously, together with the crystallite size of each. Since the sample was a very thin, 50-?m slab of dispersed 20-?m diameter grains, textural and morphological features normally encountered during studies with fixed beds of NiO particles were absent and measurements reflected only the chemical mechanism and kinetics. The results indicated that reduction in the absence of water added to the reducing gas followed a series of steps: (1) an induction period associated with the initial reduction ofNiO and the appearance of Ni metal clusters; (2) acceleration of the reduction rate as the size of the clusters increase; and (3) a pseudo-first-order (excess H2) process in which NiO disappeared and Ni appeared in concert until reduction slowed at a fractional conversion of about 0.8. Crystallite size measurements showed NiO crystallites ofabout 3 nm in size were transformed into Ni crystallites ofmore than 20 nm, implying that Ni0 ion transport following reduction was very fast due to the close proximity of the NiO crystallites being reduced. When 2.2 × 10−2 atm ofH2O was added to the reducing gas, induction times increased by approximately a factor of two and reduction rates decreased (increasingly at lower temperatures) with an apparent activation energy of 126 ± 27 kJ mol−1 compared to 85±6kJmol−1 without added water. The lag between NiO reduction and Ni growth observed in previous studies was not seen, indicating that textural and morphological factors are very important in establishing the role ofwater vapor in the reduction process.},

The catalytic performance of the samples for volatile organic compounds (VOC), CH3OH, CO and CH4oxidation was evaluated. Cerium allows an enhancement of the reducibility of the B-site cations in perovskite structure during OSC and TPR-H2and an increase in the amount of $\beta$-O2desorbed during TPD-O2. As opposed to cerium, the addition of iron in the perovskite structure causes a drop in B-site cations reducibility and a decrease of the oxygen mobility in the bulk. As a consequence, the catalytic activity in VOC oxidation is enhanced by introduction of cerium and weakened by iron in the lattice. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The fracture mechanism of porous silicon carbide (SiC) was investigated by using the acoustic emission (AE) technique. Four point bending tests were conducted at different loading speeds, and integrated with AE monitoring. The results revealed that the quasi-static fatigue behavior had a critical role on the degradation of fracture strength, and fracture was caused by the microcracks of binder. For the AEs detected during the bending tests, source wave analysis of AE was carried out in order to quantitatively estimate the volume of microcrack. It was found that the crack volume was slightly smaller than that of binder fracture observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), thus suggested that the small crack propagates in the binder and produces AEs. It was also found that the longer the testing time, the smaller the microcrack occurred at the lower stress level. Therefore, the fracture mechanism of the porous SiC was found to be controlled by particle binder fracture, which is time dependent. In addition, AE is testified as a useful technique to monitor the small crack of binder, which plays a very important role in material strength and filtering function of porous SiC. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract = {A solid oxide fuel cell is an electrochemical device which converts the Gibbs free enthalpy of the combustion reaction of a fuel and an oxidant gas (air) as far as possible directly into electricity. Hydrogen and oxygen are used to illustrate the simplest case. This allows the calculation of the reversible work for the reversible reaction. Heat must be transferred reversibly as well to the surrounding environment in this instance. During the operation of a SOFC, two effects are identified to reduce the electrical power available from an ideal cell; the first is the ohmic resistance which generates heat, and the second is the irreversible mixing of gases which causes a voltage drop. Generally, this means that an SOFC is not able to convert the complete fuel. In a real SOFC system, heat is exchanged within the SOFC in several ways including fuel processing, air preheating, flue gas cooling, etc. The excess air is commonly required to prevent overheating, while the conversion of hydrocarbons into hydrogen and carbon monoxide often absorbs heat. The released heat of a SOFC can be used within a heat engine such as a piston engine or a gas turbine. These combined SOFC/heat engine cycles are analysed as well.},

abstract = {The development of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes by infiltration of Pd/Gd-doped cerium oxide (CGO) electrocatalysts in Nb-doped SrTiO3(STN) backbones has been investigated. Modification of the electrode/electrolyte interface by thin layer of spin-coated CGO (400-500 nm) contributed to a significant improvement in performance of the STN backbones and infiltrated electrodes. The improvement is due to the result of CGO enrichment at the interface. The impedance analysis showed that addition of Pd further increased the electrode reaction rate with a factor 10 with respect to the CGO electrocatalysts. Very low electrode polarization resistances of 0.055 $\Omega$ cm2(after excluding the gas diffusion limitation contribution) and 1.2 $\Omega$ cm2at 600 C and 400 C, respectively, have been obtained in 3{\%} H2/H2O. A gradual decrease in polarization resistance was achieved with increasing loading of Pd-CGO electrocatalyst. The microstructural analysis of the infiltrated Pd-CGO electrocatalyst on STN revealed a homogenous coating of Pd and CGO nanoparticles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The rise of shale gas development through horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing has expanded oil and gas exploration in the USA. The rapid rate of shale gas exploration has triggered an intense public debate regarding the potential environmental and human health effects. A review of the updated literature has identified four potential risks for impacts on water resources: (1) stray gas contamination of shallow aquifers near shale gas sites; (2) contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater from spills, leaks, and disposal of inadequately treated wastewater or hydraulic fracturing fluids; (3) accumulation of toxic and radioactive residues in soil or stream sediments near disposal or spill sites; and (4) over-extraction of water resources for drilling and hydraulic fracturing that could induce water shortages and conflicts with other water users, particularly in water-scarce areas. As part of a long-term research on the potential water contamination associated with shale gas development, new geochemical and isotopic techniques have been developed for delineating the origin of gases and contaminants in water resource. In particular, multiple geochemical and isotopic (carbon isotopes in hydrocarbons, noble gas, strontium, boron, radium isotopes) tracers have been utilized to distinguish between naturally occurring dissolved gas and salts in water and contamination directly induced from shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations.},

abstract = {The published literature relating to damage to SOFCs caused by redox cycling of Ni-based anodes is reviewed. The review covers the kinetics of Ni oxidation and NiO reduction (as single phases and as constituents of composites with yttria-stabilised zirconia, YSZ), the dimensional changes associated with redox cycling and the effect of this on the mechanical integrity and electrical performance of cells and stacks. A critical parameter is the expansion strain that is caused by oxidation. Several studies report that the first complete oxidation of a Ni/YSZ composite causes a linear expansion of the order of 1{\%}, but the actual values vary substantially between different investigations. The oxidation strain is the result of microstructural irreversibility during the redox process and leads to strain accumulation over several redox cycles. This can cause mechanical disruption to an anode, anode support or other cell components attached to the anode.A simplified mechanical model of the stress and damage that are likely to be caused by anode expansion is proposed and applied to anode-supported, electrolyte-supported and inert substrate-supported cell configurations. This allows the maximum oxidation strain to avoid damage in each configuration to be estimated.},

abstract = {Application of individual distributed generators can cause as many problems as it may solve. A better way to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a "microgrid". During disturbances, the generation and corresponding loads can separate from the distribution system to isolate the microgrid's load from the disturbance (providing UPS services) without harming the transmission grid's integrity. This ability to island generation and loads together has a potential to provide a higher local reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole. In this model it is also critical to be able to use the waste heat by placing the sources near the heat load. This implies that a unit can be placed at any point on the electrical system as required by the location of the heat load.},

With the CPP, U.S. renewable energy use in 2020 would be 7{\%} (about 1 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case, and in 2040 it would be 37{\%} (4 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case.

abstract = {For brittle failures, the probability distribution of structural strength and lifetime are known to be Weibullian, in which case the knowledge of the mean and standard deviation suffices to determine the loading or time corresponding to a tolerable failure probability such as 10(-6). Unfortunately, this is not so for quasibrittle structures, characterized by material inhomogeneities that are not negligible compared with the structure size (as is typical, e. g. for concrete, fibre composites, tough ceramics, rocks and sea ice). For such structures, the distribution of structural strength was shown to vary from almost Gaussian to Weibullian as a function of structure size (and also shape). Here we predict the size dependence of the distribution type for the lifetime of quasibrittle structures. To derive the lifetime statistics from the strength statistics, the subcritical crack growth law is requisite. This empirical law is shown to be justified by fracture mechanics of random crack jumps in the atomic lattice and the condition of equality of the energy dissipation rates calculated on the nano-scale and the macro-scale. The size effect on the lifetime is found to be much stronger than that on the structural strength. The theory is shown to match the experimentally observed systematic deviations of lifetime histograms from the Weibull distribution.},

We show how significant information about the charge distribution around vacancies in cerium oxide can be gained from a study of high resolution crystal structures of higher order oxides which exhibit ordering of oxygen vacancies. Specifically, we consider the implications of a bond valence sum analysis of Ce 7 O 12 and Ce 11 O 20 . To illuminate our analysis we show alternative representations of the crystal structures in terms of orderly arrays of coordination defects and in terms of fluorite-type modules. We found that in Ce 7 O 12 , the excess charge resulting from removal of an oxygen atom delocalizes among all three triclinic Ce sites closest to the O vacancy. In Ce 11 O 20 , the charge localizes on the next nearest neighbour Ce atoms. Our main result is that the charge prefers to distribute itself so that it is farthest away from the O vacancies. This contradicts the standard picture of charge localization which assumes that each of the two excess electrons localizes on one of the cerium ions nearest to the vacancy. This standard picture is assumed in most calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Based on the known crystal structure of Pr 6 O 11 , we also predict that the charge in Ce 6 O 11 will be found in the second coordination shell of the O vacancy. We also extend the analysis to the Magn{\'{e}}li phases of titanium and vanadium oxides (M n O 2 n − 1 , where M = Ti, V) and consider the problem of metal–insulator transitions (MIT) in these oxides. We found that the bond valence analysis may provide a useful predictive tool in structures where the MIT is accompanied by significant changes in the metal–oxygen bond lengths. Although this review focuses mainly on bulk cerium oxides with some extension to the Magn{\'{e}}li phases of titanium and vanadium, our approach to characterizing electronic properties of oxygen vacancies and the physical insights gained should also be relevant to surface defects and to other rare earth and transition metal oxides.},

abstract = {Solid electrolytes are increasingly being used in active electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and batteries. Several fuel cells or batteries are connected in series to form a stack or a battery pack. The present manuscript examines the phenomenon of degradation in such devices, whose origin lies in the very basics of local thermodynamic equilibrium and transport. The specific example of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is addressed here. If a single cell (or a few cells) in a stack exhibits higher resistance than the rest of the cells, stack failure often initiates at such a cell. The cell is then driven by, and exhibits lower voltage than the rest of the cells, and often even a negative voltage. The objective of this paper is to present a model for stack degradation when one of the cells exhibits a negative voltage. The existence of low level electronic conduction through the electrolyte plays central role in degradation. It is shown that if a cell exhibits a negative voltage, the oxygen chemical potential within the electrolyte can exceed that in the oxidant, and/or can drop below that in the fuel. This can lead to high internal oxygen partial pressure resulting in electrode cracking and delamination, and/or very low oxygen partial pressure leading to local electrolyte decomposition. Both situations can lead to cell and stack degradation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data reveals that SFM crystallizes in the simple cubic perovskite structure with iron and molybdenum disordered on the B-site. No structure transition was observed by variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction measurements in the temperature range of 25-800 ??C. XPS results show that the iron and molybdenum valences change with an increase in temperature, where the mixed oxidation states of both iron and molybdenum are believed to be responsible for the increase in the electrical conductivity with increasing temperature. SFM exhibits excellent redox stability and has been used as both anode and cathode for solid oxide fuel cells. Presence of sulfur species in the fuel or direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuel can result in loss of activity, however, as shown in this paper, the anode performance can be regenerated from sulfur poisoning or coking by treating the anode in an oxidizing atmosphere. Thus, SFM can be used as a regenerating anode for direct oxidation of sulfur-containing hydrocarbon fuels. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Zirconia tapes are established for the application as electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells. One of their functional tasks is to provide the structural integrity of the cell. The mechanical failure of the electrolyte would cause leakage between the electrodes, leading to a reduction of the performance of a whole fuel cell stack. In order to assess the reliability of a certain zirconia tape with respect to a specific stress distribution and environment, the strength has to be properly characterised. In the present study a selection of several commercial highly ionic conductive scandia doped zirconia tapes was investigated regarding their strength under inert and humid conditions at room temperature, which required the determination of the elastic constants and the fracture toughness as well. The strength of the different zirconia tapes ranks according to their fracture toughness, while the strength distributions typically exhibit a Weibull modulus of m = 10. It was found that all tapes suffer from sub critical crack growth, which leads to a limited lifetime at a given static load and a drastic reduction of the room temperature strength at time scales relevant for actual operation.},

In the concentration overpotential, both ordinary and Knudsen diffusions are considered to cater for different porous electrode designs. Sensitivity tests are then conducted to show the effect of the thickness of the respective fuel cell components on the drop in cell voltage. Results show that the performance of an anode-supported fuel cell is superior to that using cathode as the support under elevated operating pressure in the cathode compartment.

abstract = {Solid-Oxide-Fuel-Cell systems are efficient devices to convert the chemical energy stored in fuels into electricity. The functionality of the cell is related to the structural integrity of the ceramic electrolyte, since its failure can lead to drastic performance losses. The mechanical property which is of most interest is the strength distribution at all relevant temperatures and how it is affected with time due to the environment. This study investigates the impact of the temperature on the strength and the fracture toughness of different zirconia electrolytes as well as the change of the elastic constants. 3YSZ and 6ScSZ materials are characterised regarding the influence of sub critical crack growth (SCCG) as one of the main lifetime limiting effects for ceramics at elevated temperatures. In addition, the reliability of different zirconia tapes is assessed with respect to temperature and SCCG. It was found that the strength is only influenced by temperature through the change in fracture toughness. SCCG has a large influence on the strength and the lifetime for intermediate temperature, while its impact becomes limited at temperatures higher than 650 °C. In this context the tetragonal 3YSZ and 6ScSZ behave quite different than the cubic 10Sc1CeSZ, so that at 850 °C it can be regarded as competitive compared to the tetragonal compounds.},

abstract = {The electrolyte of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an O2--ion conductor. The anode must oxidize the fuel with O2-ions received from the electrolyte and it must deliver electrons of the fuel chemisorption reaction to a current collector. Cells operating on H2and CO generally use a porous Ni/electrolyte cermet that supports a thin, dense electrolyte. Ni acts as both the electronic conductor and the catalyst for splitting the H2bond; the oxidation of H2to H2O occurs at the Ni/electrolyte/H2triple-phase boundary (TPB). The CO is oxidized at the oxide component of the cermet, which may be the electrolyte, yttria-stabilized zirconia, or a mixed oxide-ion/electron conductor (MIEC). The MIEC is commonly a Gd-doped ceria. The design and fabrication of these anodes are evaluated. Use of natural gas as the fuel requires another strategy, and MIECs are being explored for this application. The several constraints on these MIECs are outlined, and preliminary results of this on-going investigation are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems have been recognized as the most advanced power generation system with the highest thermal efficiency with a compatibility with wide variety of hydrocarbon fuels, synthetic gas from coal, hydrogen, etc. However, SOFC requires high temperature operation to achieve high ion conductivity of ceramic electrolyte, and thus SOFC should be heated up first before fuel is supplied into the stack. This paper presents computational model for thermal dynamics of planar SOFC stack during start-up process. SOFC stack should be heated up as quickly as possible from ambient temperature to above 700 ??C, while minimizing net energy consumption and thermal gradient during the heat up process. Both cathode and anode channels divided by current-collecting ribs were modeled as one-dimensional flow channels with multiple control volumes and all the solid structures were discretized into finite volumes. Two methods for stack-heating were investigated; one is with hot air through cathode channels and the other with electric heating inside a furnace. For the simulation of stack-heating with hot air, transient continuity, flow momentum, and energy equation were applied for discretized control volumes along the flow channels, and energy equations were applied to all the solid structures with appropriate heat transfer model with surrounding solid structures and/or gas channels. All transient governing equations were solved using a time-marching technique to simulate temporal evolution of temperatures of membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA), ribs, interconnects, flow channels, and solid housing structure located inside the insulating chamber. For electrical heating, uniform heat flux was applied to the stack surface with appropriate numerical control algorithm to maintain the surface temperature to certain prescribed value. The developed computational model provides very effective simulation tool to optimize stack-heating process minimizing net heating energy and thermal gradient within the stack. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Direct oxidation tests show that the electrolyte cracks for a conversion degree of Ni into NiO ranging between ???58 and ???71{\%}. This failure mode has been modelled considering both the bulk expansion of the cermet induced by the transformation of the Ni phase and the change of mechanical stresses in the multilayered cell. In the case of fuel starvation, a thin layer of the cermet was electrochemically re-oxidised at 800 ??C and then reduced under a hydrogen stream. This 'redox' cycle was repeated until the degradation of the cell. The evolution of the impedance diagrams recorded after each cycle suggests that the cermet damages in an area close to anode/electrolyte interface. The mechanical modelling states that a delamination can occur along the interface between the Anode Functional Layer (AFL) and the Anode Current Collector (ACC) substrate.

abstract = {To evaluate the reliability of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks during operation, the stress field in the stack must be known. During operation the stress field will depend on time as creep processes relax stresses. The creep of reduced Ni-YSZ anode support at operating conditions has been studied previously. In this work a newly discovered creep phenomenon taking place during the reduction is reported. This relaxes stresses at a much higher rate (?????104) than creep during operation. The phenomenon was studied both in three-point bending and uniaxial tension. Differences between the two measurements could be explained by newly observed stress promoted reduction. Finally, samples exposed to a small tensile stress (???0.004 MPa) were observed to expand during reduction, which is in contradiction to previous literature. These observations suggest that release of internal residual stresses between the NiO and the YSZ phases occurs during reduction. The accelerated creep should practically eliminate any residual stress in the anode support in an SOFC stack, as has previously been indirectly observed. This phenomenon has to be taken into account both in the production of stacks and in the simulation of the stress field in a stack based on anode supported SOFCs.},

As general features, physicochemical properties and cell performance degradation/failure are correlated and bridged by the electrode reaction mechanisms. Particular emphasis is placed on the elemental behaviour of gaseous impurities and the possible role of liquids formed from gaseous substances. The lifetime of a state-of-the-art Ni cermet anodes is limited by a variety of microstructural changes, which mainly result from material transport-, deactivation- and thermomechanical mechanisms. Anode degradation can mainly be influenced by processing, conceptual and operating parameters. Designing a redox stable anode is currently one of the biggest challenges for small scale SOFC systems. Degradation mechanisms of different cathode materials are reviewed with a focus on the intrinsic degradation of doped lanthanum manganites (e.g. LSM) and doped lanthanum ferro-cobaltites (LSCF). Manganese-based perovskites can be regarded to be sufficiently stable, while for the better performing LSCF cathodes some intrinsic degradation was detected. New materials that are supposed to combine a better stability and high performance are also shortly mentioned. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {For solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) one key aspect is the structural integrity of the cell and hence its thermo mechanical long term behaviour. The present study investigates the failure mechanisms and the actual causes for fracture of electrolyte supported SOFCs which were run using the current ??-CHP system of Hexis AG, Winterthur - Switzerland under lab conditions or at customer sites for up to 40,000 h. In a first step several operated stacks were demounted for post-mortem inspection, followed by a fractographic evaluation of the failed cells. The respective findings are then set into a larger picture including an analysis of the present stresses acting on the cell like thermal and residual stresses and the measurements regarding the temperature dependent electrolyte strength. For all investigated stacks, the mechanical failure of individual cells can be attributed to locally acting bending loads, which rise due to an inhomogeneous and uneven contact between the metallic interconnect and the cell.?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The phase stability, nonstoichiometry and point defect chemistry of polycrystalline Sr 2FeMoO 6-?? (SFMO) was studied by thermogravimety at 1000, 1100, and 1200 ??C. Single-phase SFMO exists between -10.2???log pO 2???-13.7 at 1200 ??C. At lower oxygen partial pressure a mass loss signals reductive decomposition. At higher pO 2 a mass gain indicates oxidative decomposition into SrMoO 4 and SrFeO 3-x. The nonstoichiometry ?? at 1000, 1100, and 1200 ??C was determined as function of pO 2. SFMO is almost stoichiometric at the upper phase boundary (e.g. ??=0.006 at 1200 ??C and log pO 2=-10.2) and becomes more defective with decreasing oxygen partial pressure (e.g. ??=0.085 at 1200 ??C and log pO 2=-13.5). Oxygen vacancies are shown to represent majority defects. From the temperature dependence of the oxygen vacancy concentration the defect formation enthalpy was estimated (??H OV=253??8 kJ/mol). Samples of different nonstoichiometry ?? were prepared by quenching from 1200 ??C at various pO 2. An increase of the unit cell volume with increasing defect concentration ?? was found. The saturation magnetization is reduced with increasing nonstoichiometry ??. This demonstrates that in addition to Fe/Mo site disorder, oxygen nonstoichiometry is another source of reduced magnetization values. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The volume change associated with this phase transformation is only about 1{\%}, thus having little effect on other properties. The total electrical conductivity increases with the content of Mn, whereas the resistance to sulfur poisoning increases with the content of Cr.

Model cells with a porous interlayer showed complex stress conditions that deviated from in-plane stress due to their porosity, and the model cell was confirmed not to be suitable for this method. At high temperatures, compressive stress was found to decrease as temperature increased and was almost neutral at the operating temperatures of the fuel cell, with good replication.

The porosity of the as-sintered samples varied from 9 to 38{\%} and that of the reduced ones from 31 to 52{\%}. For all samples a linear relation between Young's modulus and porosity was found. The temperature dependency of the mechanical properties of both as-sintered and reduced composites was investigated by IET up to 1200 ??C. In the as-sintered state, first an increase and peak of stiffness coinciding with the N??el temperature, 250 ??C, of NiO was observed. Above this temperature, a linear decrease occurred. Specific damping showed a peak at 170-180 ??C and increased above ca. 1000 ??C in NiO-YSZ. In the reduced state the elastic modulus decreased linearly with temperature; specific damping increased above ca. 600 ??C and was found to be very dependent on microstructure. Damage caused by redox cycling degraded the elastic properties of the composites. Degradation started linearly from 0.5 to 0.6{\%} redox strain leading to macroscopic sample failures at about 2.5{\%} dL/Lo.

abstract = {The stress state and cell degradation have been modelled considering the classical solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) materials (Ni-YSZ//YSZ//LSM). The anode-supported cell is found to be un-cracked after its elaboration. However, the high level of energy stored in the thin electrolyte layer lowers the cell robustness as it constitutes the driving force for interfacial delamination. The elaboration of the electrolyte supported cell leads to the anode layer cracking. The heating up to 800 ??C and the cermet reduction allow relaxing the stress level in the cell. For the anode-supported cell, the cermet re-oxidation induces cathode damage as soon as the anodic strain exceeds 0.05-0.09{\%} whereas the electrolyte fracture occurs for strain ranging between 0.12{\%} and 0.15{\%}. For the electrolyte supported cell, the cermet re-oxidation induces a triggered risk of anode/electrolyte delamination when the anodic strain is higher than 0.3-0.35{\%}. The risk of rupture initiation in cell singularities has been also investigated. A pure material electrode/electrolyte singularity is harmless. A perpendicular corner at the electrode/electrolyte free edge constitutes a harmful singularity. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The microstructural stability at elevated temperatures and the mechanical properties of 8 mol{\%} yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) has been investigated. The YSZ was supplied by two manufacturers as 150 $\mu$m thick sheet suitable for the electrolyte in a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The two materials had the cubic structure and this crystal structure was maintained up to 1100°C, which was the highest temperature investigated. However, there were differences, albeit small in most cases, in composition, density, grain size and surface finish between the products from the two manufacturers. Although the compositional and structural variations resulted in some differences in mechanical performance, the general trends shown by both materials were similar. The strength, as determined by biaxial flexure, fell by 23–30{\%} on increasing the test temperature from room temperature (RT) to the SOFC operating temperature of 950°C and there was evidence for changes in crack initiation and propagation mechanisms at the higher temperature. The loading rate dependence of the RT strength yielded a low value for the stress exponent n in the standard lifetime equation, which indicated that sub-critical crack growth (sccg) was sensitive to applied stress. Constant load tests at 950–1000°C illustrated the sensitivity of sccg to stress and revealed that creep was also operative in this temperature range. It was concluded that the creep probably occurred by a grain boundary diffusion mechanism.},

The load-displacement curves recorded on porous alumina samples showed a transition between a typical brittle behavior at porosity fractions below 60. vol{\%} and a damageable, cellular-like behavior, at higher porosity fractions. This transition in fracture mode was confirmed by in situ compression tests in an X-ray tomograph. Based on a simple model taking into account the competition between the crack length initiating from spherical pores and the mean distance between pores, the porosity at which the transition took place was estimated. The influence of the pore size also depended on the volume fraction of pores: no size effect was noted at the lowest porosity whereas a statistical effect on the size of the solid walls was observed at higher porosity, with an increase in fracture strength with small pores. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we report the elastic behavior of three classical materials used in SOFCs as a function of temperature: Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and Ni-YSZ. Both YSZ and LSM present unusual behaviors. The elastic modulus of YSZ first decreases slowly up to 150 °C, then dramatically up to 550 °C (certainly due to atomic motion) and finally increases probably because of an order-disorder transition (oxygen vacancies). The state of the art on zirconia was reviewed. For the LSM material, Young's modulus could not be determined below 600 °C. Above this temperature, samples with totally closed porosity present a continuously increasing modulus, while the other samples have a quite constant modulus. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A methodology is proposed in this study to investigate the creep properties of porous Ni-8YSZ cermet. Creep experiments have been conducted under reducing atmosphere at the typical SOFC operating temperatures. Specimens have been loaded in a four-point bending test bench. A special attention has been paid in this work to the analytical and numerical modelling of the mechanical test. It has been highlighted that Ni-8YSZ exhibits substantial creep strain rates even at relative low temperatures (700??C{\textless}T{\textless}850??C). The creep exponent has been found to be just slightly higher than unity (1{\textless}n{\textless}2) while the activation energy has been determined equal to Q=115kJmol-1.High-temperature plastic strains of both Ni and 8YSZ phases have been estimated through the local stress acting on the cermet particles. This analysis indicates that creep behaviour of the Ni-8YSZ composite is not influenced by the metallic phase, but is controlled by the deformation of the 8YSZ matrix. It is also proposed that cermet creep mechanism involves Zr4+cations diffusion at the surface rather than in the bulk of the 8YSZ material. Impact of the Ni-8YSZ cermet creep on the internal stresses distribution in SOFC is discussed considering the anode supported cell (ASC) design. It is shown that cermet creep strain can induce a substantial stress decrease in the thin electrolyte. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Most fuel-cell research has involved the use of hydrogen as the fuel, although the practical generation and storage of hydrogen remains an important technological hurdle. Methane has been successfully oxidized electrochemically, but the susceptibility to carbon formation from other hydrocarbons that may be present or poor power densities have prevented the application of this simple fuel in practical applications. Here we report the direct, electrochemical oxidation of various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, 1-butene, n-butane and toluene) using a solid-oxide fuel cell at 973 and 1,073 K with a composite anode of copper and ceria (or samaria-doped ceria). We demonstrate that the final products of the oxidation are CO2 and water, and that reasonable power densities can be achieved. The observation that a solid-oxide fuel cell can be operated on dry hydrocarbons, including liquid fuels, without reforming, suggests that this type of fuel cell could provide an alternative to hydrogen-based fuel-cell technologies.},

abstract = {Fuel cell technology is quite promising for conversion of chemical energy of hydrocarbon fuels into electricity without forming air pollutants. There are several types of fuel cells: polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC), molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and alkaline fuel cell (AFC). Among these, SOFCs are the most efficient and have various advantages such as flexibility in fuel, high reliability, simple balance of plant (BOP), and a long history. Therefore, SOFC technology is attracting much attention as a power plant and is now close to marketing as a combined heat and power generation system. From the beginning of SOFC development, many perovskite oxides have been used for SOFC components; for example, LaMnO -based oxide for the cathode and 3 LaCrO for the interconnect are the most well known materials for SOFCs. The 3 current SOFCs operate at temperatures higher than 1073 K. However, lowering the operating temperature of SOFCs is an important goal for further SOFC development. Reliability, durability, and stability of the SOFCs could be greatly improved by decreasing their operating temperature. In addition, a lower operating temperature is also beneficial for shortening the startup time and decreasing energy loss from heat radiation. For this purpose, faster oxide ion conductors are required to replace the conventional Y O -stabilized ZrO 2 3 2 electrolyte. A new class of electrolytes such as LaGaO is considered to be 3 highly useful for intermediate-temperature SOFCs.},

@article{Virkar2014,
abstract = {It is well known that many electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries, etc. degrade under various operating conditions. Many devices are based on solid electrolytes. In many cases, degradation manifests as electrode delamination and/or cracking of the electrolyte. An apparently obvious conclusion often reached is that this must be due to weak interfaces and some approach to mechanical strengthening or toughening should alleviate the problem. It is the intent of this manuscript to show that such electrochemical degradation often occurs due to electrochemical-mechanical coupling effects which result in extremely large internal pressures. So large can be the pressures that no amount conventional strengthening or toughening can prevent degradation. In fact, even a perfect lattice can be disrupted by electrochemically induced pressure leading to failures. In order to prevent failures, it is necessary to fully understand the role of coupling and develop strategies of mitigating high pressure formation by optimizing ion and electron transporting properties of the membrane. This manuscript discusses a fundamental mechanism of electrochemical failure of solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide electrolyzer cells, and oxygen separators based on oxygen ion conducting solid electrolytes. Experimental results on two types solid electrolyte cells are presented in support of the mechanism. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {This contribution gives an overview of different fracture-mechanics issues occurring in layered ceramics designed with internal compressive residual stresses (such as the edge cracking, crack arrest by the compressive layer or crack deflection/bifurcation) and proposes an effective approach to describe the initiation and/or propagation of cracks in such materials. The finite fracture mechanics (FFM) theory and the coupled stress-energy criterion (CC) are discussed and applied to understand their fracture behavior. The stress-energy coupled criterion is based on the tensile strength and toughness data of investigated material and it does not contain any adjustable parameter, which is its indisputable advantage. It could thus (in the considered brittle materials) predict both crack initiation and crack propagation under consideration of both thermal and external mechanical loading. A case study is investigated, where edge cracking in compressive layers can be predicted as a function of the thickness of the compressive layer and the magnitude of residual stresses. Another case study concerns the onset of a crack in a notched sample of a layered ceramic submitted to bending. The propagation of the crack through the ceramic laminate is studied as a function of the volume ratio of particular material components and corresponding magnitude of residual stresses in both compressive and tensile layers. Under certain combination of residual stress and layered architecture, the CC predicts crack arrest in the internal compressive layer of the laminate in accordance with experimental observations under similar loading conditions.},

abstract = {Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH(4) L(-1) (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L(-1) (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and $\delta$(2)H-CH(4) values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and-possibly-regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO(2) concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO(2) concentrations exceeding approximately 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

Variations of volcanic aerosols and possibly solar luminosity appear to be primary causes of observed fluctuations about the mean trend of increasing temperature. It is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century, and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980's.

abstract = {Fuel cells are uniquely capable of overcoming combustion efficiency limitations (e.g., the Carnot cycle). However, the linking of fuel cells (an energy conversion device) and hydrogen (an energy carrier) has emphasized investment in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells as part of a larger hydrogen economy and thus relegated fuel cells to a future technology. In contrast, solid oxide fuel cells are capable of operating on conventional fuels (as well as hydrogen) today. The main issue for solid oxide fuel cells is high operating temperature (about 800 degrees C) and the resulting materials and cost limitations and operating complexities (e.g., thermal cycling). Recent solid oxide fuel cells results have demonstrated extremely high power densities of about 2 watts per square centimeter at 650 degrees C along with flexible fueling, thus enabling higher efficiency within the current fuel infrastructure. Newly developed, high-conductivity electrolytes and nanostructured electrode designs provide a path for further performance improvement at much lower temperatures, down to {\~{}}350 degrees C, thus providing opportunity to transform the way we convert and store energy.},

abstract = {The reduction and oxidation (redox) kinetics of a Ni/YSZ cermet were studied at temperatures between 400 and 850??C by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and reduction and oxidation activation energies were determined. In addition, the volume change after redox cycling was examined by thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Samples with fine microstructure similar to a typical SOFC anode functional layer (AFL) and samples with coarse microstructure similar to a typical anode substrate were characterized. Coarse structured samples experienced no volume change or cracking upon redox cycling. Fine structured anode samples did not change in volume after reduction, but expanded between 0.9{\%} and 2.5{\%} after oxidation. The samples were significantly cracked after oxidation. The amount of expansion and cracking was reduced by lowering the Ni content of the anode and by reducing the oxidation temperature. The reduction of the NiO/YSZ samples followed linear kinetics with an activation energy of 78 kJ/mol. Ni/YSZ oxidation followed parabolic kinetics at temperatures lower than 700??C. A divergence from parabolic kinetics was seen at higher temperatures (700-850??C). This divergence has been seen in many other kinetic studies and is usually attributed to short-circuit diffusion mechanisms. An activation energy of 87 kJ/mol was calculated for oxidation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The double perovskite Sr2MgMoO6 - $\delta$(SMM) has been proposed as a potential anode material for direct hydrocarbon oxidation in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The oxygen nonstoichiometry and electrical conductivity dependence of Sr2MgMoO6 - $\delta$have been determined as a function of the oxygen partial pressure by coulometric titration and impedance spectroscopy techniques. The chemical compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6 - $\delta$with most of the typical electrolytes commonly used in SOFCs i.e. La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 - $\delta$(LSGM), Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 - $\delta$(CGO) and Zr0.84Y0.16O2 - $\delta$(YSZ), was investigated. Reactivity between SMM and all these electrolytes has been found above 1000 °C, although the reaction is most severe with ZrO2-based electrolytes. Area-specific polarisation resistance of the SMM/LSGM/SMM symmetrical cells indicates that the polarisation resistance increases with the firing temperature of the electrodes due to chemical interaction between LSGM and SMM layers. A CGO buffer layer between the anode and electrolyte was also used to prevent an excessive interdiffusion of ionic species between these components, resulting in better performance. Power densities of 330 and 270 mW cm- 2were reached at 800 °C for SMM/CGO/LSGM/LSCF and SMM/LSGM/LSCF electrolyte-supported cells, respectively; with 600-$\mu$m-thick LSGM electrolyte, using humidified H2as fuel and air as oxidant. XPS and XRPD studies on SMM powders annealed in air and diluted CH4atmospheres showed that the surface of SMM powders is mainly formed by SrMoO4and metal carbonates. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In order for solid oxide fuel cells to survive the mechanical loading associated with residual manufacturing stresses, assembly, thermal mismatches, ion activity gradients, or operational loading, one or more components of the cell must provide sufficient mechanical strength. In anode-supported electrolyte designs, the anode layer is called upon to provide the necessary mechanical strength, in addition to fulfilling its electrical and electrochemical roles. To investigate how the starting powder sizes and how the reduction process parameters influenced the strength of NiO(Ni)-YSZ anode laminates, concentric ring-on-ring, biaxial flexure experiments were performed. Two composite microstructures and two reduction processes were examined. One specimen was obtained from powders with only fine (?????2????m) NiO and YSZ particles, while the other had a bi-modal distribution of coarse and fine particles of NiO (11????m and 5????m) and YSZ (4????m and 1????m). One reduction process introduces forming gas at room temperature, while the other process introduced forming gas only after the specimen reached its reduction temperature (600 or 800????C). The anodes containing coarse and fine particles had slower reduction rates, poorly connected microstructures, and had 35-40{\%} lower biaxial flexure strengths than anodes with only fine starting powders. The temperature at which forming gas was introduced had a significant impact on the microstructural evolution and thus also on the mechanical properties. Although introducing forming gas at room temperature led to more complete and faster reductions, the resulting microstructures were poorly connected, and the reduced laminates had almost 30{\%} less strength than laminates that were reduced at constant temperature. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The results reveal that the elastic modulus of both pure ceria and GDC decreases drastically in samples heat treated at very low partial pressures of oxygen.

It was found that the elastic moduli of GDC under oxidizing conditions gradually decreased with increasing temperature in a constant atmosphere and was almost independent of p(O2) at a constant temperature. However, under reducing conditions, the elastic moduli apparently decreased as p(O2) decreased even at a constant temperature, and such a decrease became more considerable under lower p(O2) conditions. The variation in the elastic moduli of GDC with p(O2) seemed to reflect the variation in the oxygen nonstoichiometry ??. It was demonstrated that the elastic moduli are affected not only by the change in the interatomic distance due to the chemical and/or the thermal expansion but also by the variation in the oxygen nonsotichiometry and the average valence of cerium ions. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent thermodynamic and electrical conductivity data are evaluated to select the most appropriate electrolyte composition for IT-SOFC operation at 500°C. Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has an ionic lattice conductivity of 10−2 Scm−1 at 500°C, and the Gd3+ ion is the preferred dopant, compared to Sm3+ and Y3+, at this temperature. Thermodynamic investigations indicate that for CeO2–Re2O3 solid solutions at intermediate temperatures it becomes easier to reduce Ce4+ as the concentration of Re2O3 is increased. As the associated electron mobilities do not appear to be a strong function of composition it follows that Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has a wider ionic domain than Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 at intermediate temperatures. Particular attention is drawn to the deleterious effects of impurities (principally SiO2) which are responsible for large dopant concentration dependent grain boundary resistivities. These grain boundary resistivities can obscure the intrinsic lattice ionic conductivities and cause investigators to select non-optimal dopant compositions. It follows that the use of clean (SiO2{\textless}50 ppm) powders is strongly recommended, particularly as these are now commercially available. At present there is also no compelling evidence to confirm that the intrinsic lattice electronic conductivity is significantly changed by co-doping with Pr6O11. Finally the I–V characteristics of single cells incorporating 25-$\mu$m thick Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolytes are modelled, and the requirements for composite electrodes briefly discussed so that power densities of 0.4 Wcm−2 at 500°C can be attained.},

A decoupling of both magnetic and structural behaviour has been found in all cases except for T=Cr and Fe, ruling out a simple magnetostructural effect. A third transition (Ttetra) where the system becomes metrically cubic has been found and its nonequivalence to TSinvestigated in detail.
