abstract = {Ceria-based solid electrolytes are reviewed in terms of electrical conductivity, diffusivity and transference number. The electrical conductivity and diffusion constants of various fluorite compounds are compared and those of ceria-based oxides are almost the highest among these fluorite oxides. The electrical conductivity of doped ceria is much dependent on the kind and the concentration of dopants. The reason for this behavior and a guideline to obtain more electrically conductive materials are discussed. The effect of sample preparation on the electrical conductivity is described in terms of the character of raw materials, impurities and the sintering condition. The factors to determine the transference number and the methods to increase the transference number at low oxygen pressures are also discussed.},

abstract = {The double perovskite Sr2MgMoO6 - $\delta$(SMM) has been proposed as a potential anode material for direct hydrocarbon oxidation in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The oxygen nonstoichiometry and electrical conductivity dependence of Sr2MgMoO6 - $\delta$have been determined as a function of the oxygen partial pressure by coulometric titration and impedance spectroscopy techniques. The chemical compatibility of Sr2MgMoO6 - $\delta$with most of the typical electrolytes commonly used in SOFCs i.e. La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3 - $\delta$(LSGM), Ce0.8Gd0.2O2 - $\delta$(CGO) and Zr0.84Y0.16O2 - $\delta$(YSZ), was investigated. Reactivity between SMM and all these electrolytes has been found above 1000 °C, although the reaction is most severe with ZrO2-based electrolytes. Area-specific polarisation resistance of the SMM/LSGM/SMM symmetrical cells indicates that the polarisation resistance increases with the firing temperature of the electrodes due to chemical interaction between LSGM and SMM layers. A CGO buffer layer between the anode and electrolyte was also used to prevent an excessive interdiffusion of ionic species between these components, resulting in better performance. Power densities of 330 and 270 mW cm- 2were reached at 800 °C for SMM/CGO/LSGM/LSCF and SMM/LSGM/LSCF electrolyte-supported cells, respectively; with 600-$\mu$m-thick LSGM electrolyte, using humidified H2as fuel and air as oxidant. XPS and XRPD studies on SMM powders annealed in air and diluted CH4atmospheres showed that the surface of SMM powders is mainly formed by SrMoO4and metal carbonates. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A solid oxide fuel cell is an electrochemical device which converts the Gibbs free enthalpy of the combustion reaction of a fuel and an oxidant gas (air) as far as possible directly into electricity. Hydrogen and oxygen are used to illustrate the simplest case. This allows the calculation of the reversible work for the reversible reaction. Heat must be transferred reversibly as well to the surrounding environment in this instance. During the operation of a SOFC, two effects are identified to reduce the electrical power available from an ideal cell; the first is the ohmic resistance which generates heat, and the second is the irreversible mixing of gases which causes a voltage drop. Generally, this means that an SOFC is not able to convert the complete fuel. In a real SOFC system, heat is exchanged within the SOFC in several ways including fuel processing, air preheating, flue gas cooling, etc. The excess air is commonly required to prevent overheating, while the conversion of hydrocarbons into hydrogen and carbon monoxide often absorbs heat. The released heat of a SOFC can be used within a heat engine such as a piston engine or a gas turbine. These combined SOFC/heat engine cycles are analysed as well.},

abstract = {SrCoO3−$\delta$ outperforms as cathode material in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) when the three-dimensional (3C-type) perovskite structure is stabilized by the inclusion of highly-charged transition-metal ions at the octahedral positions. In a previous work we studied the Nb incorporation at the Co positions in the SrCo1−xNbxO3−$\delta$ system, in which the stabilization of a tetragonal P4/mmm perovskite superstructure was described for the x = 0.05 composition. In the present study we extend this investigation to the x = 0.10–0.15 range, also observing the formation of the tetragonal P4/mmm structure instead of the unwanted hexagonal phase corresponding to the 2H polytype. We also investigated the effect of Nb5+ doping on the thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of SrCo1−xNbxO3−$\delta$ (x = 0.1 and 0.15) perovskite oxides performing as cathodes in SOFC. In comparison with the undoped hexagonal SrCoO3−$\delta$ phase, the resulting compounds present high thermal stability and an increase of the electrical conductivity. The single-cell tests for these compositions (x = 0.10 and 0.15) with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3−$\delta$ (LSGM) as electrolyte and SrMo0.8Fe0.2CoO3−$\delta$ as anode gave maximum power densities of 693 and 550 mW∙cm−2 at 850 °C respectively, using pure H2 as fuel and air as oxidant.},

abstract = {The fundamental issues associated with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) durability have been reviewed with an emphasis on general features in SOFCs and respective anode and cathode related phenomena. As general features, physicochemical properties and cell performance degradation/failure are correlated and bridged by the electrode reaction mechanisms. Particular emphasis is placed on the elemental behaviour of gaseous impurities and the possible role of liquids formed from gaseous substances. The lifetime of a state-of-the-art Ni cermet anodes is limited by a variety of microstructural changes, which mainly result from material transport-, deactivation- and thermomechanical mechanisms. Anode degradation can mainly be influenced by processing, conceptual and operating parameters. Designing a redox stable anode is currently one of the biggest challenges for small scale SOFC systems. Degradation mechanisms of different cathode materials are reviewed with a focus on the intrinsic degradation of doped lanthanum manganites (e.g. LSM) and doped lanthanum ferro-cobaltites (LSCF). Manganese-based perovskites can be regarded to be sufficiently stable, while for the better performing LSCF cathodes some intrinsic degradation was detected. New materials that are supposed to combine a better stability and high performance are also shortly mentioned. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The rise of shale gas development through horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing has expanded oil and gas exploration in the USA. The rapid rate of shale gas exploration has triggered an intense public debate regarding the potential environmental and human health effects. A review of the updated literature has identified four potential risks for impacts on water resources: (1) stray gas contamination of shallow aquifers near shale gas sites; (2) contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater from spills, leaks, and disposal of inadequately treated wastewater or hydraulic fracturing fluids; (3) accumulation of toxic and radioactive residues in soil or stream sediments near disposal or spill sites; and (4) over-extraction of water resources for drilling and hydraulic fracturing that could induce water shortages and conflicts with other water users, particularly in water-scarce areas. As part of a long-term research on the potential water contamination associated with shale gas development, new geochemical and isotopic techniques have been developed for delineating the origin of gases and contaminants in water resource. In particular, multiple geochemical and isotopic (carbon isotopes in hydrocarbons, noble gas, strontium, boron, radium isotopes) tracers have been utilized to distinguish between naturally occurring dissolved gas and salts in water and contamination directly induced from shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations.},

abstract = {We present a systematic and thorough structural study of the double perovskite series Sr2Fe0.75T0.25MoO6(T=Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co) by means of high resolution neutron diffraction as a function of temperature. The results have been complemented with room-temperature X-ray diffraction, magnetotransport and magnetisation measurements. Our study reveals the exceptionally strong influence of the 3d dopant on both long-range magnetic order (TC) and structural transition to a low-temperature tetragonal phase (TS). A decoupling of both magnetic and structural behaviour has been found in all cases except for T=Cr and Fe, ruling out a simple magnetostructural effect. A third transition (Ttetra) where the system becomes metrically cubic has been found and its nonequivalence to TSinvestigated in detail. In the case of T=Sc, Mn, a further symmetry reduction to a low-temperature monoclinic structure has been detected. The obtained results are discussed in terms of the size and valence state of the dopant, and correlated with the magnetic and electrical transport properties. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier SAS.

It is intended that GSAS-II will eventually replace both the GSAS and the EXPGUI packages, as well as many other utilities. GSAS-II is open source and is written largely in object-oriented Python but offers speeds comparable to compiled code because of its reliance on the Python NumPy and SciPy packages for computation. It runs on all common computer platforms and offers highly integrated graphics, both for a user interface and for interpretation of parameters. The package can be applied to all stages of crystallographic analysis for constant-wavelength X-ray and neutron data. Plans for considerable additional development are discussed.},

Nanoindentation is used to measure the mechanical properties for each phase of NiO-YSZ and CoO-YSZ eutectics produced by the laser floating zone technique, and also the analogues Ni-YSZ and Co-YSZ cermets produced by reduction from the eutectic precursors. The different tests have been performed at 100 nm, in order to obtain an imprint lower than the size of the secondary phase and extract the hardness and Young's modulus. Moreover, several tests have been performed at 2000 nm of indentation range to obtain the response of each material.

abstract = {This contribution gives an overview of different fracture-mechanics issues occurring in layered ceramics designed with internal compressive residual stresses (such as the edge cracking, crack arrest by the compressive layer or crack deflection/bifurcation) and proposes an effective approach to describe the initiation and/or propagation of cracks in such materials. The finite fracture mechanics (FFM) theory and the coupled stress-energy criterion (CC) are discussed and applied to understand their fracture behavior. The stress-energy coupled criterion is based on the tensile strength and toughness data of investigated material and it does not contain any adjustable parameter, which is its indisputable advantage. It could thus (in the considered brittle materials) predict both crack initiation and crack propagation under consideration of both thermal and external mechanical loading. A case study is investigated, where edge cracking in compressive layers can be predicted as a function of the thickness of the compressive layer and the magnitude of residual stresses. Another case study concerns the onset of a crack in a notched sample of a layered ceramic submitted to bending. The propagation of the crack through the ceramic laminate is studied as a function of the volume ratio of particular material components and corresponding magnitude of residual stresses in both compressive and tensile layers. Under certain combination of residual stress and layered architecture, the CC predicts crack arrest in the internal compressive layer of the laminate in accordance with experimental observations under similar loading conditions.},

abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems have been recognized as the most advanced power generation system with the highest thermal efficiency with a compatibility with wide variety of hydrocarbon fuels, synthetic gas from coal, hydrogen, etc. However, SOFC requires high temperature operation to achieve high ion conductivity of ceramic electrolyte, and thus SOFC should be heated up first before fuel is supplied into the stack. This paper presents computational model for thermal dynamics of planar SOFC stack during start-up process. SOFC stack should be heated up as quickly as possible from ambient temperature to above 700 ??C, while minimizing net energy consumption and thermal gradient during the heat up process. Both cathode and anode channels divided by current-collecting ribs were modeled as one-dimensional flow channels with multiple control volumes and all the solid structures were discretized into finite volumes. Two methods for stack-heating were investigated; one is with hot air through cathode channels and the other with electric heating inside a furnace. For the simulation of stack-heating with hot air, transient continuity, flow momentum, and energy equation were applied for discretized control volumes along the flow channels, and energy equations were applied to all the solid structures with appropriate heat transfer model with surrounding solid structures and/or gas channels. All transient governing equations were solved using a time-marching technique to simulate temporal evolution of temperatures of membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA), ribs, interconnects, flow channels, and solid housing structure located inside the insulating chamber. For electrical heating, uniform heat flux was applied to the stack surface with appropriate numerical control algorithm to maintain the surface temperature to certain prescribed value. The developed computational model provides very effective simulation tool to optimize stack-heating process minimizing net heating energy and thermal gradient within the stack. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The load-displacement curves recorded on porous alumina samples showed a transition between a typical brittle behavior at porosity fractions below 60. vol{\%} and a damageable, cellular-like behavior, at higher porosity fractions. This transition in fracture mode was confirmed by in situ compression tests in an X-ray tomograph. Based on a simple model taking into account the competition between the crack length initiating from spherical pores and the mean distance between pores, the porosity at which the transition took place was estimated. The influence of the pore size also depended on the volume fraction of pores: no size effect was noted at the lowest porosity whereas a statistical effect on the size of the solid walls was observed at higher porosity, with an increase in fracture strength with small pores. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hydrogen reduction of porous bulk NiO particles has been studied with in situ hot-stage X-ray diffraction (XRD) in the temperature range175–300 ◦C. This technique has the ability to measureNiOdisappearance andNiappearance simultaneously, together with the crystallite size of each. Since the sample was a very thin, 50-?m slab of dispersed 20-?m diameter grains, textural and morphological features normally encountered during studies with fixed beds of NiO particles were absent and measurements reflected only the chemical mechanism and kinetics. The results indicated that reduction in the absence of water added to the reducing gas followed a series of steps: (1) an induction period associated with the initial reduction ofNiO and the appearance of Ni metal clusters; (2) acceleration of the reduction rate as the size of the clusters increase; and (3) a pseudo-first-order (excess H2) process in which NiO disappeared and Ni appeared in concert until reduction slowed at a fractional conversion of about 0.8. Crystallite size measurements showed NiO crystallites ofabout 3 nm in size were transformed into Ni crystallites ofmore than 20 nm, implying that Ni0 ion transport following reduction was very fast due to the close proximity of the NiO crystallites being reduced. When 2.2 × 10−2 atm ofH2O was added to the reducing gas, induction times increased by approximately a factor of two and reduction rates decreased (increasingly at lower temperatures) with an apparent activation energy of 126 ± 27 kJ mol−1 compared to 85±6kJmol−1 without added water. The lag between NiO reduction and Ni growth observed in previous studies was not seen, indicating that textural and morphological factors are very important in establishing the role ofwater vapor in the reduction process.},

abstract = {The fracture mechanism of porous silicon carbide (SiC) was investigated by using the acoustic emission (AE) technique. Four point bending tests were conducted at different loading speeds, and integrated with AE monitoring. The results revealed that the quasi-static fatigue behavior had a critical role on the degradation of fracture strength, and fracture was caused by the microcracks of binder. For the AEs detected during the bending tests, source wave analysis of AE was carried out in order to quantitatively estimate the volume of microcrack. It was found that the crack volume was slightly smaller than that of binder fracture observed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM), thus suggested that the small crack propagates in the binder and produces AEs. It was also found that the longer the testing time, the smaller the microcrack occurred at the lower stress level. Therefore, the fracture mechanism of the porous SiC was found to be controlled by particle binder fracture, which is time dependent. In addition, AE is testified as a useful technique to monitor the small crack of binder, which plays a very important role in material strength and filtering function of porous SiC. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

The true density and apparent density were measured to calculate the relative density$\backslash$r of GDC ceramics. The change in relative density revealed that densification of GDC ceramics$\backslash$r increased up to 1200°C, and thereafter turned downward. It was suggested that pores were formed at$\backslash$r 1300°C and 1400°C due to non-stoichiometry of ceria. JIS-type specimens were cut from the sintered$\backslash$r body and tested by 4-point bending. Young's modulus and bending strength decreased with increasing$\backslash$r the sintering temperature from 1200°C to 1400°C, corresponding to the change in the relative$\backslash$r density.},

No structure transition was observed by variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction measurements in the temperature range of 25-800 ??C. XPS results show that the iron and molybdenum valences change with an increase in temperature, where the mixed oxidation states of both iron and molybdenum are believed to be responsible for the increase in the electrical conductivity with increasing temperature. SFM exhibits excellent redox stability and has been used as both anode and cathode for solid oxide fuel cells. Presence of sulfur species in the fuel or direct utilization of hydrocarbon fuel can result in loss of activity, however, as shown in this paper, the anode performance can be regenerated from sulfur poisoning or coking by treating the anode in an oxidizing atmosphere. Thus, SFM can be used as a regenerating anode for direct oxidation of sulfur-containing hydrocarbon fuels. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Cerium allows an enhancement of the reducibility of the B-site cations in perovskite structure during OSC and TPR-H2and an increase in the amount of $\beta$-O2desorbed during TPD-O2. As opposed to cerium, the addition of iron in the perovskite structure causes a drop in B-site cations reducibility and a decrease of the oxygen mobility in the bulk.

abstract = {Fuel cell technology is quite promising for conversion of chemical energy of hydrocarbon fuels into electricity without forming air pollutants. There are several types of fuel cells: polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC), phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC), molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and alkaline fuel cell (AFC). Among these, SOFCs are the most efficient and have various advantages such as flexibility in fuel, high reliability, simple balance of plant (BOP), and a long history. Therefore, SOFC technology is attracting much attention as a power plant and is now close to marketing as a combined heat and power generation system. From the beginning of SOFC development, many perovskite oxides have been used for SOFC components; for example, LaMnO -based oxide for the cathode and 3 LaCrO for the interconnect are the most well known materials for SOFCs. The 3 current SOFCs operate at temperatures higher than 1073 K. However, lowering the operating temperature of SOFCs is an important goal for further SOFC development. Reliability, durability, and stability of the SOFCs could be greatly improved by decreasing their operating temperature. In addition, a lower operating temperature is also beneficial for shortening the startup time and decreasing energy loss from heat radiation. For this purpose, faster oxide ion conductors are required to replace the conventional Y O -stabilized ZrO 2 3 2 electrolyte. A new class of electrolytes such as LaGaO is considered to be 3 highly useful for intermediate-temperature SOFCs.},

abstract = {The electrolyte of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an O2--ion conductor. The anode must oxidize the fuel with O2-ions received from the electrolyte and it must deliver electrons of the fuel chemisorption reaction to a current collector. Cells operating on H2and CO generally use a porous Ni/electrolyte cermet that supports a thin, dense electrolyte. Ni acts as both the electronic conductor and the catalyst for splitting the H2bond; the oxidation of H2to H2O occurs at the Ni/electrolyte/H2triple-phase boundary (TPB). The CO is oxidized at the oxide component of the cermet, which may be the electrolyte, yttria-stabilized zirconia, or a mixed oxide-ion/electron conductor (MIEC). The MIEC is commonly a Gd-doped ceria. The design and fabrication of these anodes are evaluated. Use of natural gas as the fuel requires another strategy, and MIECs are being explored for this application. The several constraints on these MIECs are outlined, and preliminary results of this on-going investigation are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, replacing Ni-cermet is challenging for low-temperature operating SOFCs (LT-SOFCs) employing ceria based mixed ionic and electronic conducting electrolytes. Here we successfully prepared a new perovskite oxide composition (e.g. SrFe0.2Co0.4Mo0.4O3-$\delta$) to function as an alternative anode-support for LT-SOFCs (400-650 oC), exhibiting a high conductivity of 35 S/cm at 600oC. Further, we fabricated anode-supported SOFC with an optimized anode composition. Our LT-SOFC design constitutes of a unique Co-doped GDC layer deposited at the interface of cathode/electrolyte junction, resulting in improved OCV by preventing diffusion of elements from anode to electrolyte. The studied LT-SOFCs showed high peak power densities of 730 mW/cm2 and 300 mW/cm2 at an ambitious low temperatures of 550oC and 450oC, respectively, in humidified H2. Although catalytic activity in ceramic anode was incorporated by infiltrating Ni-GDC solution, stability was not compromised in hydrocarbon gases, we demonstrated stable long-term operation over a period of 380h in CH4–containing gas mixtures at 450oC . High performance is attributed to the improvement in OCV and reduction of parasitic losses (e.g. ohmic/non-ohmic area specific resistances).},

abstract = {Fracture toughness of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3- (LSCF) in both bulk and film forms after sintering at 900 degrees C to 1200 degrees C was measured using both single-edge V-notched beam (SEVNB) 3-point bending and Berkovich indentation. FIB/SEM slice-and-view observation after indentation revealed the presence of Palmqvist radial crack systems after indentation of the bulk materials. Based on crack length measurements, the fracture toughness of bulk LSCF specimens was determined to be in the range 0.54-0.99MPam(1/2) (depending on sintering temperature), in good agreement with the SEVNB measurements (0.57-1.13MPam(1/2)). The fracture toughness was approximately linearly dependent on porosity over the range studied. However, experiments on films showed that the generation of observable indentation-induced cracks was very difficult for films sintered at temperatures below 1200 degrees C. This was interpreted as being the result of the substrate having much higher modulus than these films. Cracks were only detectable in the films sintered at 1200 degrees C and gave an apparent toughness of 0.17MPam(1/2) using the same analysis as for bulk specimens. This value is much smaller than that for bulk material with the same porosity. The residual thermal expansion mismatch stress measured using XRD was found to be responsible for such a low apparent toughness.},

The 4 wt {\%} Ni content in the anode was necessary to obtain good performance, indicating that a small amount of Ni provides a substantial electrocatalytic effect while not causing coking.

Dramatic improvements in power densities have been achieved in both SOFC and PEMFC systems through reduction of the electrolyte thickness and architectural control of the composite electrodes. Current efforts are aimed at reducing SOFC costs by lowering operating temperatures to 500-800 ??C, and reducing PEMFC system complexity be developing 'water-free' membranes which can also be operated at temperatures slightly above 100 ??C. ?? 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

In the concentration overpotential, both ordinary and Knudsen diffusions are considered to cater for different porous electrode designs. Sensitivity tests are then conducted to show the effect of the thickness of the respective fuel cell components on the drop in cell voltage. Results show that the performance of an anode-supported fuel cell is superior to that using cathode as the support under elevated operating pressure in the cathode compartment. The former can achieve an improved operating range of current density under normal atmospheric conditions.},

This temperature increase is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect due to measured increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Variations of volcanic aerosols and possibly solar luminosity appear to be primary causes of observed fluctuations about the mean trend of increasing temperature. It is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century, and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980's. Potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought-prone regions in North America and central Asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones, erosion of the West Antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.},

abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO(2) concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO(2) concentrations exceeding approximately 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

abstract = {Application of individual distributed generators can cause as many problems as it may solve. A better way to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a "microgrid". During disturbances, the generation and corresponding loads can separate from the distribution system to isolate the microgrid's load from the disturbance (providing UPS services) without harming the transmission grid's integrity. This ability to island generation and loads together has a potential to provide a higher local reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole. In this model it is also critical to be able to use the waste heat by placing the sources near the heat load. This implies that a unit can be placed at any point on the electrical system as required by the location of the heat load.},

abstract = {The direct electrochemical oxidation of dry hydrocarbon fuels to generate electrical power has the potential to accelerate substantially the use of fuel cells in transportation and distributed-power applications. Most fuel-cell research has involved the use of hydrogen as the fuel, although the practical generation and storage of hydrogen remains an important technological hurdle. Methane has been successfully oxidized electrochemically, but the susceptibility to carbon formation from other hydrocarbons that may be present or poor power densities have prevented the application of this simple fuel in practical applications. Here we report the direct, electrochemical oxidation of various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, 1-butene, n-butane and toluene) using a solid-oxide fuel cell at 973 and 1,073 K with a composite anode of copper and ceria (or samaria-doped ceria). We demonstrate that the final products of the oxidation are CO2 and water, and that reasonable power densities can be achieved. The observation that a solid-oxide fuel cell can be operated on dry hydrocarbons, including liquid fuels, without reforming, suggests that this type of fuel cell could provide an alternative to hydrogen-based fuel-cell technologies.},

abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology has been under development for a broad range of power generation applications. The attractiveness of this technology is its efficient and clean production of electricity from a variety of fuels. The main features of the SOFC are all solid-state construction and high-temperature operation. The combination of these features leads to a number of unique characteristics and advantages for this type of fuel cell, including flexibility in cell and stack designs, manufacturing processes, and power plant sizes. This paper discusses and summarizes the SOFC's features and provides an overview of this technology's potential applications. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH(4) L(-1) (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L(-1) (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and $\delta$(2)H-CH(4) values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and-possibly-regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

The IEO2016 Reference case assumes known technologies and technological and demographic trends, generally reflects the effects of current policies, and does not anticipate new policies that have not been announced (see box below). The IEO2016 Reference case projections do not include the effects of the recently finalized Clean Power Plan (CPP) regulations in the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) preliminary analysis of the proposed CPP 9 shows potential reductions of 21{\%} (about 4 quadrillion Btu) in U.S. coal consumption in 2020 and 24{\%} (almost 5 quadrillion Btu) in 2040 relative to the IEO2016 Reference case projection. With the CPP, U.S. renewable energy use in 2020 would be 7{\%} (about 1 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case, and in 2040 it would be 37{\%} (4 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case.

However, under reducing conditions, the elastic moduli apparently decreased as p(O2) decreased even at a constant temperature, and such a decrease became more considerable under lower p(O2) conditions. The variation in the elastic moduli of GDC with p(O2) seemed to reflect the variation in the oxygen nonstoichiometry ??.

In addition, the volume change after redox cycling was examined by thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Samples with fine microstructure similar to a typical SOFC anode functional layer (AFL) and samples with coarse microstructure similar to a typical anode substrate were characterized. Coarse structured samples experienced no volume change or cracking upon redox cycling. Fine structured anode samples did not change in volume after reduction, but expanded between 0.9{\%} and 2.5{\%} after oxidation. The samples were significantly cracked after oxidation. The amount of expansion and cracking was reduced by lowering the Ni content of the anode and by reducing the oxidation temperature. The reduction of the NiO/YSZ samples followed linear kinetics with an activation energy of 78 kJ/mol. Ni/YSZ oxidation followed parabolic kinetics at temperatures lower than 700??C. A divergence from parabolic kinetics was seen at higher temperatures (700-850??C). This divergence has been seen in many other kinetic studies and is usually attributed to short-circuit diffusion mechanisms. An activation energy of 87 kJ/mol was calculated for oxidation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The published literature relating to damage to SOFCs caused by redox cycling of Ni-based anodes is reviewed. The review covers the kinetics of Ni oxidation and NiO reduction (as single phases and as constituents of composites with yttria-stabilised zirconia, YSZ), the dimensional changes associated with redox cycling and the effect of this on the mechanical integrity and electrical performance of cells and stacks. A critical parameter is the expansion strain that is caused by oxidation. Several studies report that the first complete oxidation of a Ni/YSZ composite causes a linear expansion of the order of 1{\%}, but the actual values vary substantially between different investigations. The oxidation strain is the result of microstructural irreversibility during the redox process and leads to strain accumulation over several redox cycles. This can cause mechanical disruption to an anode, anode support or other cell components attached to the anode.A simplified mechanical model of the stress and damage that are likely to be caused by anode expansion is proposed and applied to anode-supported, electrolyte-supported and inert substrate-supported cell configurations. This allows the maximum oxidation strain to avoid damage in each configuration to be estimated.},

abstract = {The processing of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) often involves co-sintering of multi-layered stacks. In the case of SOFCs incorporating Ni-based anodes, hydrogen reduction of the anode usually takes place during the first service cycle of operation or conditioning. Initial reduction causes changes in the chemistry, microstructure and properties of the Ni-based anode material, which in turn induce mechanical stresses in the cell. In this study the elastic moduli, biaxial strength and fracture toughness of unreduced (NiO-YSZ) and reduced (Ni-YSZ) anode were determined as functions of porosity. Elastic properties were determined by impulse excitation at ambient temperature. Biaxial strength and fracture toughness were determined at ambient temperature by the ring-on-ring and double torsion test methods, respectively. It was found that the mechanical properties of unreduced and reduced Ni-based anode materials depend strongly on porosity. Property-porosity trends were found to be in good agreement with prediction of the minimum solid area model. Results presented in this study show that the elastic moduli and biaxial strength of the Ni-based anode material decreases after reduction in hydrogen while fracture toughness increases after reduction due to formation of ductile Ni-metal phase.

Both YSZ and LSM present unusual behaviors. The elastic modulus of YSZ first decreases slowly up to 150 °C, then dramatically up to 550 °C (certainly due to atomic motion) and finally increases probably because of an order-disorder transition (oxygen vacancies). The state of the art on zirconia was reviewed. For the LSM material, Young's modulus could not be determined below 600 °C. Above this temperature, samples with totally closed porosity present a continuously increasing modulus, while the other samples have a quite constant modulus. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the effect of anode reduction and oxidation cycling on typical electrolyte supported cell (ESC) has been investigated. The electrochemical degradation has been followed by impedance spectroscopy. The cell damage has been characterised after testing with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It has been shown that cells can withstand several 'redox' cycles without major decrease in electrochemical performances. The 'redox' cycling induces only a slight degradation rate estimated to ???70 m?? cm2 per cycle. The microstructural observations are found to be consistent with the impedance diagram analysis.

Damage mechanisms have been studied in both cases of direct oxidation in air (i.e., fuel shutdown) or by an ionic current (i.e., fuel starvation). Direct oxidation tests show that the electrolyte cracks for a conversion degree of Ni into NiO ranging between ???58 and ???71{\%}. This failure mode has been modelled considering both the bulk expansion of the cermet induced by the transformation of the Ni phase and the change of mechanical stresses in the multilayered cell. In the case of fuel starvation, a thin layer of the cermet was electrochemically re-oxidised at 800 ??C and then reduced under a hydrogen stream. This 'redox' cycle was repeated until the degradation of the cell. The evolution of the impedance diagrams recorded after each cycle suggests that the cermet damages in an area close to anode/electrolyte interface. The mechanical modelling states that a delamination can occur along the interface between the Anode Functional Layer (AFL) and the Anode Current Collector (ACC) substrate.

abstract = {For solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) one key aspect is the structural integrity of the cell and hence its thermo mechanical long term behaviour. The present study investigates the failure mechanisms and the actual causes for fracture of electrolyte supported SOFCs which were run using the current ??-CHP system of Hexis AG, Winterthur - Switzerland under lab conditions or at customer sites for up to 40,000 h. In a first step several operated stacks were demounted for post-mortem inspection, followed by a fractographic evaluation of the failed cells. The respective findings are then set into a larger picture including an analysis of the present stresses acting on the cell like thermal and residual stresses and the measurements regarding the temperature dependent electrolyte strength. For all investigated stacks, the mechanical failure of individual cells can be attributed to locally acting bending loads, which rise due to an inhomogeneous and uneven contact between the metallic interconnect and the cell.?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Laurencin2008,
abstract = {The stress state and cell degradation have been modelled considering the classical solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) materials (Ni-YSZ//YSZ//LSM). The anode-supported cell is found to be un-cracked after its elaboration. However, the high level of energy stored in the thin electrolyte layer lowers the cell robustness as it constitutes the driving force for interfacial delamination. The elaboration of the electrolyte supported cell leads to the anode layer cracking. The heating up to 800 ??C and the cermet reduction allow relaxing the stress level in the cell. For the anode-supported cell, the cermet re-oxidation induces cathode damage as soon as the anodic strain exceeds 0.05-0.09{\%} whereas the electrolyte fracture occurs for strain ranging between 0.12{\%} and 0.15{\%}. For the electrolyte supported cell, the cermet re-oxidation induces a triggered risk of anode/electrolyte delamination when the anodic strain is higher than 0.3-0.35{\%}. The risk of rupture initiation in cell singularities has been also investigated. A pure material electrode/electrolyte singularity is harmless. A perpendicular corner at the electrode/electrolyte free edge constitutes a harmful singularity. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wachsman2011a,
abstract = {Fuel cells are uniquely capable of overcoming combustion efficiency limitations (e.g., the Carnot cycle). However, the linking of fuel cells (an energy conversion device) and hydrogen (an energy carrier) has emphasized investment in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells as part of a larger hydrogen economy and thus relegated fuel cells to a future technology. In contrast, solid oxide fuel cells are capable of operating on conventional fuels (as well as hydrogen) today. The main issue for solid oxide fuel cells is high operating temperature (about 800 degrees C) and the resulting materials and cost limitations and operating complexities (e.g., thermal cycling). Recent solid oxide fuel cells results have demonstrated extremely high power densities of about 2 watts per square centimeter at 650 degrees C along with flexible fueling, thus enabling higher efficiency within the current fuel infrastructure. Newly developed, high-conductivity electrolytes and nanostructured electrode designs provide a path for further performance improvement at much lower temperatures, down to {\~{}}350 degrees C, thus providing opportunity to transform the way we convert and store energy.},
