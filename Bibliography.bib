The M=Mg phase is stable both under reducing and oxidizing conditions, showing variable oxygen contents within 0.00≤$\delta$≤0.04 depending on the annealing conditions.

abstract = {An investigation of the electrical properties of reduced ceria, CeO2-x, carried out on single crystals, shows that CeO2-xprovides one of the clearest examples of hopping conduction and the small polaron mechanism. Included are conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements at constant x, obtained by sealing off the specimen chamber after reduction. The Seebeck coefficient is independent of temperature, suggesting that the number of carriers is constant. On the other hand, the mobility is activated, with activation energy Eh= 0.40 eV at small x and increasing to 0.52 eV at x = 0.25. The results for the mobility preexponential are consistent with the adiabatic theory of small polaron behavior. A puzzling feature of the Seebeck data as a function of x is that, for low x, the data fit the well-known Heikes formula, without a degeneracy factor of 2 for spin. Nevertheless, these data are interpreted to show that the proportion of mobile carriers decreases as x increases, presumably because of the presence of short-range ordered configurations which immobilize some carriers. {\textcopyright} 1977.},

Owing to their excellent mixed-ionic and electronic conductivity and fast oxygen kinetics, cation layered double perovskite oxides such as PrBaCo2O5 in particular have exhibited excellent properties as solid oxide fuel cell oxygen electrodes. Here, we show for the first time that related layered materials can be used as high-performance fuel electrodes. Good redox stability with tolerance to coking and sulphur contamination from hydrocarbon fuels is demonstrated for the layered perovskite anode PrBaMn2O5+$\delta$ (PBMO). The PBMO anode is fabricated by in situ annealing of Pr0.5Ba0.5MnO3-$\delta$ in fuel conditions and actual fuel cell operation is demonstrated. At 800 °C, layered PBMO shows high electrical conductivity of 8.16 S cm(-1) in 5{\%} H2 and demonstrates peak power densities of 1.7 and 1.3 W cm(-2) at 850 °C using humidified hydrogen and propane fuels, respectively.},

abstract = {The electrolyte of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an O2--ion conductor. The anode must oxidize the fuel with O2-ions received from the electrolyte and it must deliver electrons of the fuel chemisorption reaction to a current collector. Cells operating on H2and CO generally use a porous Ni/electrolyte cermet that supports a thin, dense electrolyte. Ni acts as both the electronic conductor and the catalyst for splitting the H2bond; the oxidation of H2to H2O occurs at the Ni/electrolyte/H2triple-phase boundary (TPB). The CO is oxidized at the oxide component of the cermet, which may be the electrolyte, yttria-stabilized zirconia, or a mixed oxide-ion/electron conductor (MIEC). The MIEC is commonly a Gd-doped ceria. The design and fabrication of these anodes are evaluated. Use of natural gas as the fuel requires another strategy, and MIECs are being explored for this application. The several constraints on these MIECs are outlined, and preliminary results of this on-going investigation are reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The electrochemical performance of the anode was improved with the increment of Ni-CGO loadings. The gas diffusion impedance was investigated with He and N2in H2/H2O gas mixtures and by varying the H2O content at 655°C.

abstract = {The development of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anodes by infiltration of Pd/Gd-doped cerium oxide (CGO) electrocatalysts in Nb-doped SrTiO3(STN) backbones has been investigated. Modification of the electrode/electrolyte interface by thin layer of spin-coated CGO (400-500 nm) contributed to a significant improvement in performance of the STN backbones and infiltrated electrodes. The improvement is due to the result of CGO enrichment at the interface. The impedance analysis showed that addition of Pd further increased the electrode reaction rate with a factor 10 with respect to the CGO electrocatalysts. Very low electrode polarization resistances of 0.055 $\Omega$ cm2(after excluding the gas diffusion limitation contribution) and 1.2 $\Omega$ cm2at 600 C and 400 C, respectively, have been obtained in 3{\%} H2/H2O. A gradual decrease in polarization resistance was achieved with increasing loading of Pd-CGO electrocatalyst. The microstructural analysis of the infiltrated Pd-CGO electrocatalyst on STN revealed a homogenous coating of Pd and CGO nanoparticles. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The fundamental issues associated with solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) durability have been reviewed with an emphasis on general features in SOFCs and respective anode and cathode related phenomena. As general features, physicochemical properties and cell performance degradation/failure are correlated and bridged by the electrode reaction mechanisms. Particular emphasis is placed on the elemental behaviour of gaseous impurities and the possible role of liquids formed from gaseous substances. The lifetime of a state-of-the-art Ni cermet anodes is limited by a variety of microstructural changes, which mainly result from material transport-, deactivation- and thermomechanical mechanisms. Anode degradation can mainly be influenced by processing, conceptual and operating parameters. Designing a redox stable anode is currently one of the biggest challenges for small scale SOFC systems. Degradation mechanisms of different cathode materials are reviewed with a focus on the intrinsic degradation of doped lanthanum manganites (e.g. LSM) and doped lanthanum ferro-cobaltites (LSCF). Manganese-based perovskites can be regarded to be sufficiently stable, while for the better performing LSCF cathodes some intrinsic degradation was detected. New materials that are supposed to combine a better stability and high performance are also shortly mentioned. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

FIB/SEM slice-and-view observation after indentation revealed the presence of Palmqvist radial crack systems after indentation of the bulk materials. Based on crack length measurements, the fracture toughness of bulk LSCF specimens was determined to be in the range 0.54-0.99MPam(1/2) (depending on sintering temperature), in good agreement with the SEVNB measurements (0.57-1.13MPam(1/2)). The fracture toughness was approximately linearly dependent on porosity over the range studied. However, experiments on films showed that the generation of observable indentation-induced cracks was very difficult for films sintered at temperatures below 1200 degrees C. This was interpreted as being the result of the substrate having much higher modulus than these films. Cracks were only detectable in the films sintered at 1200 degrees C and gave an apparent toughness of 0.17MPam(1/2) using the same analysis as for bulk specimens. This value is much smaller than that for bulk material with the same porosity. The residual thermal expansion mismatch stress measured using XRD was found to be responsible for such a low apparent toughness.},

abstract = {A fundamental issue with micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is improvement of the mechanical strength of the cell. Fabricated using extrusion and co-firing techniques, the approximately 1.7 mm diameter SOFC tubes examined in this work are composed of a 50:50 NiO and Gd0.2Ce0.8O2-xGd-doped ceria (GDC) cermet anode (support tube), GDC as an electrolyte and La0.8Sr0.2Co0.6Fe0.4O3(LSCF)-GDC as a cathode. The mechanical properties of SOFCs are analyzed through internal burst testing and micro- and nano-indentation testing; the burst test is an especially important parameter because of improved power efficiency at increased fuel pressures. Results from micro- and nano-indentation tests performed on electrolyte-coated Ni-GDC anode pellets indicate that the hardness of GDC is comparable or greater than that of YSZ. In order to develop a trend for the mechanical behavior of micro-tubes in relation to variations in fabrication techniques, several parameters were varied. The standard anodes, used as a baseline, have four key design parameters as follows: they are not reduced, contain 40 vol{\%} pore former, are sintered at 1400 °C and have a wall thickness of approximately 315 $\mu$m. An independent variation on each of the four parameters is performed. The four variations are (1) to reduce the standard tube, (2) to increase the percent pore former to 50{\%} then to 60{\%}, (3) to decrease sintering temperature to 1350 °C, and (4) to decrease the wall thickness to approximately 230 $\mu$m. An average burst strength of 22.4 ± 1.5 MPa is observed for the standard tubes, 34.2 ± 16.5 MPa for the reduced tubes, 16.5 ± 4.2 MPa for 50 vol{\%} pore former and 11.7 ± 7.5 for 60 vol{\%} pore former, 29.3 ± 9.6 MPa for the decreased sintering temperature and 34.3 ± 6.9 MPa for the thinner-walled tubes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Perovskite oxides La1−xSrxCo1−yFeyO3–$\delta$ (LSCF) have been extensively investigated and developed as cathode materials for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells  (IT-SOFCs) due to mixed ionic–electronic conductivity and high electrooxygen reduction activity for oxygen reduction. Recent literature investigations show that cathode performances can be improved by metal surface modification or B-site substitution on LSCF. Although the specific reaction mechanism needs to be further investigated, the promoting effect of metal species in enhancing oxygen surface exchange and oxygen bulk diffusion is well recognized. To our knowledge, no previous reviews dealing with the effect of metal promotion on the cathodic performances of LSCF materials have been reported. In the present review, recent progresses on metal (Pd, Pt, Ag, Cu, Zn, Ni) promotion of LSCF are discussed focusing on two main aspects, the different synthesis approaches used (infiltration, deposition, solid state reaction, one pot citrate method) and the effects of metal promotion on structural properties, oxygen vacancies content and cathodic performances. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that the metal promotion at the B-site is discussed in detail, pointing at the effects produced by two different approaches, the LSCF surface modification by the metal or the metal ion substitution at the B-site of the perovskite. Moreover, for the first time in a review article, the importance of the combined effects of oxygen dissociation rate and interfacial oxygen transfer rate between the metal phase and the cathode phase is addressed for  metal-promoted LSCF and compared with the un-promoted oxides. Perspectives on new research directions are shortly given in the conclusion.},

The nonstoichiometric deviation, ??, in (La0.7Sr0.3)(Cr1-yTiy)O3-?? (y=0.1, 0.2 and 0.3) (LSCT), (La0.75Sr0.25)(Cr0.5Mn0.5)O3-?? (LSCM) and (La0.75Sr0.25)(Cr0.5Fe0.5)O3-?? (LSCF) were measured as a function of oxygen partial pressure, PO2, at temperatures between 973 and 1373 K. The effects of partial replacement of the donor on Cr-sites were examined in LSCT. In LSCM and LSCF, effects of the partial substitution of isovalent transition metals on Cr-sites are discussed. Oxygen nonstoichiometries of various B-site mixed LaCrO3-based ceramics were compared with those of A-site substituted perovskite-type oxides, (La1-xSrx)MO3-?? (where x=0-0.3, M=Cr, Mn and Fe). The partial substitution of the different elements on Cr-sites drastically changed the PO2 and temperature dependence of oxygen vacancy formation in LaCrO3-based ceramics. The defect equilibrium relationships of the localized electron well explained the oxygen vacancy formation in B-site mixed LaCrO3-based ceramics. Oxygen vacancy formation in (La0.7Sr0.3)(Cr1-yTiy)O3-?? (y=0.1 and 0.2) and (La0.7Sr0.3)(Cr0.7Ti0.3)O3-?? was explained by redox reaction of Cr and Ti ions, respectively. The defect equilibrium relationships of LSCM and LSCF were interpreted by redox reaction of Mn ions and Fe ions, respectively. No significant change in valence state of Cr3+ ions in LSCM and LSCF was confirmed under the experimental conditions. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In devices such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), oxygen separators and membrane reactors, the mechanical properties of the ceramic components are particularly important for estimating reliability. Here we summarize some recent studies of the mechanical properties of oxygen ion-conducting ceramics for the applications mentioned. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of several materials of interest for SOFCs have now been characterized; including the effects of temperature and porosity on these parameters. The biaxial flexural strength and fracture toughness of tape-cast YSZ have been measured at room temperature and at a typical operating temperature of 900 °C. Fracture toughness decreases with increasing temperature; from 1.61±0.12 MPa m0.5at room temperature to 1.02±0.05 MPa m0.5at 900 °C. Flexural strength and fracture toughness were found to be quantitatively consistent with fracture being initiated at observed surface defects. YSZ has also been found to be susceptible to sub-critical crack growth. Many oxygen-ion conducting ceramics suffer from a chemically induced stress when subjected to a gradient in the thermodynamic activity of oxygen. Ceria and acceptor-doped lanthanum chromite are given as typical examples. One strategy for overcoming this problem in electrolytes is to laminate different materials. An example is given of CGO laminated with a thin layer of YSZ. The combined effects of improved microstructure and residual stress lead to the laminated membranes having higher apparent strength than single layer CGO membranes by a factor of between 1.75 and 4.06. Electrode/electrolyte laminates have been observed to have some unexpected behaviour.},

abstract = {Two precise algorithms are devised for the calculation of defect concentrations in A-site acceptor doped ABO3perovskites. The two models contain nine species including cation vacancies on the A- and B-site. The small polaron model is based on three redox levels of the B-ion. A large polaron model, based on delocalized electrons, electron holes and all B-ions being trivalent is given in Appendix A. The sequential mathematical method allows us to calculate the high temperature oxygen partial pressure dependent properties of (La1-xSrx)yMnO3±$\delta$in a unified manner irrespective of the type of defect regime. Simulations are shown for a pO2span from 10-30to 105atm. The three required equilibrium constants for (La1-xSrx)yMn3±$\delta$had to be changed significantly from values given in literature in order to match the observed stoichiometry span. The main results shown are calculated by the small polaron model containing only ionic species - the B-ion may be Mn′B(Mn2+), MnBx(Mn3+), and MnB(Mn4+). The A/B-ratio = y greatly influences the oxygen stoichiometry oxygen ion vacancy- and cation vacancy concentrations and the total conductivity. Calculations are given for the range 0.87≤y≤1.13 for a Sr doping of 10{\%} at 1000 °C. The defect model can simultaneously describe the observed stoichiometry and conductivity dependence on pO2, if the electronic mobility is decreased by up to 50{\%} at pO2{\textless}10-10and pO2{\textgreater}10-2atm.},

As a consequence of the high inherent deficiency in the oxygen sublattice, introduced by the mixed-valence states of the B-site cations Ti4+ and Fe3+, oxygen vacancies and interstitials generated by the anion Frenkel reaction dominate the defect equilibria, leading to predominant ionic conductivity at intermediate partial pressures of oxygen. Increasing Fe content results in both a systematic decrease in band-gap energy, E-g(0) = 3.2 - 1.9x + 0.5x2 eV, and reduction enthalpy, Delta H-red = 5.8 - 3.4x + 1.7x(2) eV. The decrease in band gap is explained on the basis of the systematic broadening of the Fe-derived 3d band lying above the O-derived 2p valence band. The Fe-induced changes in band structure were experimentally confirmed by both optical and photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopies.},

In a previous work we studied the Nb incorporation at the Co positions in the SrCo1−xNbxO3−$\delta$ system, in which the stabilization of a tetragonal P4/mmm perovskite superstructure was described for the x = 0.05 composition. In the present study we extend this investigation to the x = 0.10–0.15 range, also observing the formation of the tetragonal P4/mmm structure instead of the unwanted hexagonal phase corresponding to the 2H polytype. We also investigated the effect of Nb5+ doping on the thermal, electrical, and electrochemical properties of SrCo1−xNbxO3−$\delta$ (x = 0.1 and 0.15) perovskite oxides performing as cathodes in SOFC. In comparison with the undoped hexagonal SrCoO3−$\delta$ phase, the resulting compounds present high thermal stability and an increase of the electrical conductivity. The single-cell tests for these compositions (x = 0.10 and 0.15) with La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3−$\delta$ (LSGM) as electrolyte and SrMo0.8Fe0.2CoO3−$\delta$ as anode gave maximum power densities of 693 and 550 mW∙cm−2 at 850 °C respectively, using pure H2 as fuel and air as oxidant.},

Below 200°C and in an atmosphere of PO2 ≥ 0.13 atm, $\delta$ in La1-xSrxFeO3-$\delta$ was found to be close to 0. With decreasing log PO2, $\delta$ increased and asymptotically reached x 2. The log( PO2 atm) value corresponding to $\delta$ = x 2 was about -10 at 1000°C. With further decrease in log PO2, $\delta$ slightly increased. For LaFeO3-$\delta$, the observed $\delta$ values were as small as {\textless}0.015. It was found that the relation between $\delta$ and log PO2 is interpreted on the basis of the defect equilibrium among Sr′La (or V‴La for the case of LaFeO3-$\delta$), V{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}O, Fe′Fe, and Fe{\textperiodcentered}Fe. Calculations were made for the equilibrium constants Kox of the reaction 1 2O2(g) + V{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}o + 2FexFe = Oxo + 2Fe{\textperiodcentered}Fe and Ki for the reaction 2FexFe = Fe′Fe + Fe{\textperiodcentered}Fe{\textperiodcentered}. Using these constants, the defect concentrations were calculated as functions of PO2, temperature, and composition x.

Partial molar enthalpy and entropy of oxygen in GdBaCo2O6 - $\delta$ structure were calculated. Both thermodynamic properties were shown to increase dramatically in the vicinity of the oxygen nonstoichiometry value equal to 1. The pO2 dependences of oxygen nonstoichiometry and the $\delta$ dependences of the partial molar properties were found to have inflections when the oxygen content of GdBaCo2O6 - $\delta$ is equal to 5.0 exactly. The modeling of the defect structure of the double perovskite GdBaCo2O6 - $\delta$ was carried out by considering different reference states. Only the model based on the cubic perovskite GdCoO3 as a reference state was shown to fit the experimental data on oxygen nonstoichiometry of GdBaCo2O6 - $\delta$ good enough. Equilibrium constants of the appropriate defects reactions were, therefore, determined. Concentrations of all defect species defined within the framework of this model were calculated as functions of temperature and oxygen nonstoichiometry. Oxygen vacancies were shown to be formed during pO2 diminution in gas environment in the layers of GdBaCo2O6 - $\delta$ crystal lattice where they are ordered until oxygen nonstoichiometry of the oxide becomes equal to unity afterwards oxygen vacancies are formed randomly in oxygen polyhedrons. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Ca2+ doped lanthanum cobaltite materials are strong candidates for use as cathodes in lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells operating at or below 800 °C. Among these four cobaltite compositions, two (LaCoO3 and La0.8Ca0.2CoO3) were found to be phase pure materials, whereas the remaining two compositions (La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 and La0.45Ca0.55CoO3) contained precipitation of secondary phases such as CaO and Co3O4. The mechanical properties of the four compositions, in terms of Young's modulus, four-point bending strength and fracture toughness measurements, were measured at both room temperature and 800 °C. At room temperature, doping with Ca2+ was found to substantially increase the mechanical properties of the cobaltites, whereas at 800 °C the pure LaCoO3 composition exhibited higher modulus and strength values than La0.8Ca0.2CoO3. All of the four compositions exhibited ferroelastic behavior, as shown by the hysteresis loops generated during uniaxial load-unload compression tests. Electrical conductivity measurements showed the La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 composition to have the highest conductivity among the four compositions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Solar-driven thermochemical water splitting using non-stoichiometric oxides has emerged as an attractive technology for solar fuel production. The most widely considered oxide for this purpose is ceria, but the extreme temperatures required to achieve suitable levels of reduction introduce challenges in reactor design and operation, leading to efficiency penalties. Here, we provide a quantitative assessment of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of La1xSrxMnO3d perovskites, targeted for a reduced temperature operation of thermochemical water splitting. Sr-doping into lanthanum manganite increases the thermodynamic fuel production capacity, which reaches 9 ml g1 for 0.4 Sr for a thermochemical cycle operated between 1400 and 800 C. The hydrogen yields are moreover in good agreement with expected values based on analysis and extrapolation of thermogravimetric data available in the literature. High levels of Sr doping, however, result in low steam-to-hydrogen conversion rates, implying high energy penalties in an operational reactor. Furthermore, the rate of fuel production decreases with increasing Sr content, suggesting that intermediate compositions may yield the most suitable combination of properties.},

In this work, the flexural modulus and strength of pressed Ce0.90Gd0.10O2-x (GDC) bars are investigated under varying oxygen partial pressures at 675°C, under the same conditions SOFCs experience during operation. This is achieved by using a three-point bend fixture on a universal testing machine, with a chamber and furnace to control the environmental conditions. At operating conditions, the strength and modulus of polycrystalline bars do not follow the expected trends of quenched single grains tested by other methods.},

abstract = {Four different experimental techniques, namely resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS), impulse excitation (IE), nanoindentation (NI) and four-point bending (4PB) test were used to determine the Young's and shear moduli of 99.9{\%} pure Al2O3, 7075 aluminum, 4140 steel and Pyrex glass. The results from the different tests are compared and statistically analyzed to determine the precision of each method and to estimate the significance of the differences among the four techniques. It was found that dynamic methods (RUS and IE) have superior precision and repeatability when compared to NI and 4PB for all four tested materials. It was also found that the differences between results of RUS and IE are not statistically significant, and that NI can be equally successfully used for determining Young's modulus of well-prepared, microstructurally homogenous and relatively hard materials. 4PB was found to have the lowest precision and repeatability among the four test methods. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These ceramic-based anodes were tested in SOFCs with GDC bulk electrolytes. The anode performance was comparable to that for Ni-GDC anodes with hydrogen and methane fuels. The anodes also provided good performance with propane and butane and, unlike Ni-GDC, there was little or no coking. The 4 wt {\%} Ni content in the anode was necessary to obtain good performance, indicating that a small amount of Ni provides a substantial electrocatalytic effect while not causing coking. Initial cell test results showed good cell stability and indicated that the anodes were not affected by cyclic oxidation and reduction. {\textcopyright} 2002 The Electrochemical Society.},

We review here the current status of solid oxide (SOFC) and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMFC) fuel cells. Such solid electrolyte systems obviate the need to contain corrosive liquids and are thus preferred by many developers over alkali, phosphoric acid or molten carbonate fuel cells. Dramatic improvements in power densities have been achieved in both SOFC and PEMFC systems through reduction of the electrolyte thickness and architectural control of the composite electrodes. Current efforts are aimed at reducing SOFC costs by lowering operating temperatures to 500-800 ??C, and reducing PEMFC system complexity be developing 'water-free' membranes which can also be operated at temperatures slightly above 100 ??C. ?? 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

The Butler–Volmer equation is used in the model to describe the activation overpotential instead of using simplified expressions such as the Tafel equation and the linear current–potential equation. In the concentration overpotential, both ordinary and Knudsen diffusions are considered to cater for different porous electrode designs. Sensitivity tests are then conducted to show the effect of the thickness of the respective fuel cell components on the drop in cell voltage. Results show that the performance of an anode-supported fuel cell is superior to that using cathode as the support under elevated operating pressure in the cathode compartment. The former can achieve an improved operating range of current density under normal atmospheric conditions.},

This temperature increase is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect due to measured increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Variations of volcanic aerosols and possibly solar luminosity appear to be primary causes of observed fluctuations about the mean trend of increasing temperature. It is shown that the anthropogenic carbon dioxide warming should emerge from the noise level of natural climate variability by the end of the century, and there is a high probability of warming in the 1980's. Potential effects on climate in the 21st century include the creation of drought-prone regions in North America and central Asia as part of a shifting of climatic zones, erosion of the West Antarctic ice sheet with a consequent worldwide rise in sea level, and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.},

abstract = {The severity of damaging human-induced climate change depends not only on the magnitude of the change but also on the potential for irreversibility. This paper shows that the climate change that takes place due to increases in carbon dioxide concentration is largely irreversible for 1,000 years after emissions stop. Following cessation of emissions, removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide decreases radiative forcing, but is largely compensated by slower loss of heat to the ocean, so that atmospheric temperatures do not drop significantly for at least 1,000 years. Among illustrative irreversible impacts that should be expected if atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase from current levels near 385 parts per million by volume (ppmv) to a peak of 450-600 ppmv over the coming century are irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the "dust bowl" era and inexorable sea level rise. Thermal expansion of the warming ocean provides a conservative lower limit to irreversible global average sea level rise of at least 0.4-1.0 m if 21st century CO(2) concentrations exceed 600 ppmv and 0.6-1.9 m for peak CO(2) concentrations exceeding approximately 1,000 ppmv. Additional contributions from glaciers and ice sheet contributions to future sea level rise are uncertain but may equal or exceed several meters over the next millennium or longer.},

abstract = { Application of individual distributed generators can cause as many problems as it may solve. A better way to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a "microgrid". During disturbances, the generation and corresponding loads can separate from the distribution system to isolate the microgrid's load from the disturbance (providing UPS services) without harming the transmission grid's integrity. This ability to island generation and loads together has a potential to provide a higher local reliability than that provided by the power system as a whole. In this model it is also critical to be able to use the waste heat by placing the sources near the heat load. This implies that a unit can be placed at any point on the electrical system as required by the location of the heat load.},

abstract = {The direct electrochemical oxidation of dry hydrocarbon fuels to generate electrical power has the potential to accelerate substantially the use of fuel cells in transportation and distributed-power applications. Most fuel-cell research has involved the use of hydrogen as the fuel, although the practical generation and storage of hydrogen remains an important technological hurdle. Methane has been successfully oxidized electrochemically, but the susceptibility to carbon formation from other hydrocarbons that may be present or poor power densities have prevented the application of this simple fuel in practical applications. Here we report the direct, electrochemical oxidation of various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, 1-butene, n-butane and toluene) using a solid-oxide fuel cell at 973 and 1,073 K with a composite anode of copper and ceria (or samaria-doped ceria). We demonstrate that the final products of the oxidation are CO2 and water, and that reasonable power densities can be achieved. The observation that a solid-oxide fuel cell can be operated on dry hydrocarbons, including liquid fuels, without reforming, suggests that this type of fuel cell could provide an alternative to hydrogen-based fuel-cell technologies.},

abstract = {The rise of shale gas development through horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing has expanded oil and gas exploration in the USA. The rapid rate of shale gas exploration has triggered an intense public debate regarding the potential environmental and human health effects. A review of the updated literature has identified four potential risks for impacts on water resources: (1) stray gas contamination of shallow aquifers near shale gas sites; (2) contamination of surface water and shallow groundwater from spills, leaks, and disposal of inadequately treated wastewater or hydraulic fracturing fluids; (3) accumulation of toxic and radioactive residues in soil or stream sediments near disposal or spill sites; and (4) over-extraction of water resources for drilling and hydraulic fracturing that could induce water shortages and conflicts with other water users, particularly in water-scarce areas. As part of a long-term research on the potential water contamination associated with shale gas development, new geochemical and isotopic techniques have been developed for delineating the origin of gases and contaminants in water resource. In particular, multiple geochemical and isotopic (carbon isotopes in hydrocarbons, noble gas, strontium, boron, radium isotopes) tracers have been utilized to distinguish between naturally occurring dissolved gas and salts in water and contamination directly induced from shale gas drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations.},

abstract = {Directional drilling and hydraulic-fracturing technologies are dramatically increasing natural-gas extraction. In aquifers overlying the Marcellus and Utica shale formations of northeastern Pennsylvania and upstate New York, we document systematic evidence for methane contamination of drinking water associated with shale-gas extraction. In active gas-extraction areas (one or more gas wells within 1 km), average and maximum methane concentrations in drinking-water wells increased with proximity to the nearest gas well and were 19.2 and 64 mg CH(4) L(-1) (n = 26), a potential explosion hazard; in contrast, dissolved methane samples in neighboring nonextraction sites (no gas wells within 1 km) within similar geologic formations and hydrogeologic regimes averaged only 1.1 mg L(-1) (P {\textless} 0.05; n = 34). Average $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) values of dissolved methane in shallow groundwater were significantly less negative for active than for nonactive sites (-37 ± 7‰ and -54 ± 11‰, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). These $\delta$(13)C-CH(4) data, coupled with the ratios of methane-to-higher-chain hydrocarbons, and $\delta$(2)H-CH(4) values, are consistent with deeper thermogenic methane sources such as the Marcellus and Utica shales at the active sites and matched gas geochemistry from gas wells nearby. In contrast, lower-concentration samples from shallow groundwater at nonactive sites had isotopic signatures reflecting a more biogenic or mixed biogenic/thermogenic methane source. We found no evidence for contamination of drinking-water samples with deep saline brines or fracturing fluids. We conclude that greater stewardship, data, and-possibly-regulation are needed to ensure the sustainable future of shale-gas extraction and to improve public confidence in its use.},

The IEO2016 Reference case assumes known technologies and technological and demographic trends, generally reflects the effects of current policies, and does not anticipate new policies that have not been announced (see box below). The IEO2016 Reference case projections do not include the effects of the recently finalized Clean Power Plan (CPP) regulations in the United States. The U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) preliminary analysis of the proposed CPP 9 shows potential reductions of 21{\%} (about 4 quadrillion Btu) in U.S. coal consumption in 2020 and 24{\%} (almost 5 quadrillion Btu) in 2040 relative to the IEO2016 Reference case projection. With the CPP, U.S. renewable energy use in 2020 would be 7{\%} (about 1 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case, and in 2040 it would be 37{\%} (4 quadrillion Btu) higher than in the Reference case. U.S. consumption of petroleum and other liquid fuels and of natural gas would be slightly lower with the CPP than in the Reference case.},

abstract = {A feasible study for an in-situ stress evaluation method for solid oxide fuel cells based on Raman scattering spectroscopy was performed using two anode-supported cells with a cathode interlayer made from Samarium (Sm) doped ceria. Model cells with a dense cathode interlayer demonstrated a compressive stress of 100sMPa at room temperature, and the results were compara- ble to those from X-ray diffraction. Model cells with a porous interlayer showed complex stress conditions that deviated from in-plane stress due to their porosity, and the model cell was confirmed not to be suitable for this method. At high temperatures, compressive stress was found to decrease as temperature increased and was almost neutral at the operating temperatures of the fuel cell, with good replication. Hence, the feasibility of this method for model cells with a dense cathode interlayer was confirmed.},

abstract = {Recent thermodynamic and electrical conductivity data are evaluated to select the most appropriate electrolyte composition for IT-SOFC operation at 500°C. Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has an ionic lattice conductivity of 10−2 Scm−1 at 500°C, and the Gd3+ ion is the preferred dopant, compared to Sm3+ and Y3+, at this temperature. Thermodynamic investigations indicate that for CeO2–Re2O3 solid solutions at intermediate temperatures it becomes easier to reduce Ce4+ as the concentration of Re2O3 is increased. As the associated electron mobilities do not appear to be a strong function of composition it follows that Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 has a wider ionic domain than Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 at intermediate temperatures. Particular attention is drawn to the deleterious effects of impurities (principally SiO2) which are responsible for large dopant concentration dependent grain boundary resistivities. These grain boundary resistivities can obscure the intrinsic lattice ionic conductivities and cause investigators to select non-optimal dopant compositions. It follows that the use of clean (SiO2{\textless}50 ppm) powders is strongly recommended, particularly as these are now commercially available. At present there is also no compelling evidence to confirm that the intrinsic lattice electronic conductivity is significantly changed by co-doping with Pr6O11. Finally the I–V characteristics of single cells incorporating 25-$\mu$m thick Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 electrolytes are modelled, and the requirements for composite electrodes briefly discussed so that power densities of 0.4 Wcm−2 at 500°C can be attained.},

However, under reducing conditions, the elastic moduli apparently decreased as p(O2) decreased even at a constant temperature, and such a decrease became more considerable under lower p(O2) conditions. The variation in the elastic moduli of GDC with p(O2) seemed to reflect the variation in the oxygen nonstoichiometry ??.

In addition, the volume change after redox cycling was examined by thermomechanical analysis (TMA). Samples with fine microstructure similar to a typical SOFC anode functional layer (AFL) and samples with coarse microstructure similar to a typical anode substrate were characterized. Coarse structured samples experienced no volume change or cracking upon redox cycling. Fine structured anode samples did not change in volume after reduction, but expanded between 0.9{\%} and 2.5{\%} after oxidation. The samples were significantly cracked after oxidation. The amount of expansion and cracking was reduced by lowering the Ni content of the anode and by reducing the oxidation temperature. The reduction of the NiO/YSZ samples followed linear kinetics with an activation energy of 78 kJ/mol. Ni/YSZ oxidation followed parabolic kinetics at temperatures lower than 700??C. A divergence from parabolic kinetics was seen at higher temperatures (700-850??C). This divergence has been seen in many other kinetic studies and is usually attributed to short-circuit diffusion mechanisms.

The review covers the kinetics of Ni oxidation and NiO reduction (as single phases and as constituents of composites with yttria-stabilised zirconia, YSZ), the dimensional changes associated with redox cycling and the effect of this on the mechanical integrity and electrical performance of cells and stacks. A critical parameter is the expansion strain that is caused by oxidation. Several studies report that the first complete oxidation of a Ni/YSZ composite causes a linear expansion of the order of 1{\%}, but the actual values vary substantially between different investigations. The oxidation strain is the result of microstructural irreversibility during the redox process and leads to strain accumulation over several redox cycles. This can cause mechanical disruption to an anode, anode support or other cell components attached to the anode.A simplified mechanical model of the stress and damage that are likely to be caused by anode expansion is proposed and applied to anode-supported, electrolyte-supported and inert substrate-supported cell configurations. This allows the maximum oxidation strain to avoid damage in each configuration to be estimated.},

abstract = {In order for solid oxide fuel cells to survive the mechanical loading associated with residual manufacturing stresses, assembly, thermal mismatches, ion activity gradients, or operational loading, one or more components of the cell must provide sufficient mechanical strength. In anode-supported electrolyte designs, the anode layer is called upon to provide the necessary mechanical strength, in addition to fulfilling its electrical and electrochemical roles. To investigate how the starting powder sizes and how the reduction process parameters influenced the strength of NiO(Ni)-YSZ anode laminates, concentric ring-on-ring, biaxial flexure experiments were performed. Two composite microstructures and two reduction processes were examined. One specimen was obtained from powders with only fine (?????2????m) NiO and YSZ particles, while the other had a bi-modal distribution of coarse and fine particles of NiO (11????m and 5????m) and YSZ (4????m and 1????m). One reduction process introduces forming gas at room temperature, while the other process introduced forming gas only after the specimen reached its reduction temperature (600 or 800????C). The anodes containing coarse and fine particles had slower reduction rates, poorly connected microstructures, and had 35-40{\%} lower biaxial flexure strengths than anodes with only fine starting powders. The temperature at which forming gas was introduced had a significant impact on the microstructural evolution and thus also on the mechanical properties. Although introducing forming gas at room temperature led to more complete and faster reductions, the resulting microstructures were poorly connected, and the reduced laminates had almost 30{\%} less strength than laminates that were reduced at constant temperature. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To evaluate the reliability of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks during operation, the stress field in the stack must be known. During operation the stress field will depend on time as creep processes relax stresses. The creep of reduced Ni-YSZ anode support at operating conditions has been studied previously. In this work a newly discovered creep phenomenon taking place during the reduction is reported. This relaxes stresses at a much higher rate (?????104) than creep during operation. The phenomenon was studied both in three-point bending and uniaxial tension. Differences between the two measurements could be explained by newly observed stress promoted reduction. Finally, samples exposed to a small tensile stress (???0.004 MPa) were observed to expand during reduction, which is in contradiction to previous literature. These observations suggest that release of internal residual stresses between the NiO and the YSZ phases occurs during reduction. The accelerated creep should practically eliminate any residual stress in the anode support in an SOFC stack, as has previously been indirectly observed. This phenomenon has to be taken into account both in the production of stacks and in the simulation of the stress field in a stack based on anode supported SOFCs.},

abstract = {The Impulse Excitation Technique (IET) was used to determine the elastic modulus and specific damping of different Ni/NiO-YSZ composites suitable for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). The porosity of the as-sintered samples varied from 9 to 38{\%} and that of the reduced ones from 31 to 52{\%}. For all samples a linear relation between Young's modulus and porosity was found. The temperature dependency of the mechanical properties of both as-sintered and reduced composites was investigated by IET up to 1200 ??C. In the as-sintered state, first an increase and peak of stiffness coinciding with the N??el temperature, 250 ??C, of NiO was observed. Above this temperature, a linear decrease occurred. Specific damping showed a peak at 170-180 ??C and increased above ca. 1000 ??C in NiO-YSZ. In the reduced state the elastic modulus decreased linearly with temperature; specific damping increased above ca. 600 ??C and was found to be very dependent on microstructure. Damage caused by redox cycling degraded the elastic properties of the composites. Degradation started linearly from 0.5 to 0.6{\%} redox strain leading to macroscopic sample failures at about 2.5{\%} dL/Lo. A simple continuum elastic damage model was fitted to the degradation data. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A methodology is proposed in this study to investigate the creep properties of porous Ni-8YSZ cermet. Creep experiments have been conducted under reducing atmosphere at the typical SOFC operating temperatures. Specimens have been loaded in a four-point bending test bench. A special attention has been paid in this work to the analytical and numerical modelling of the mechanical test. It has been highlighted that Ni-8YSZ exhibits substantial creep strain rates even at relative low temperatures (700??C{\textless}T{\textless}850??C). The creep exponent has been found to be just slightly higher than unity (1{\textless}n{\textless}2) while the activation energy has been determined equal to Q=115kJmol-1.High-temperature plastic strains of both Ni and 8YSZ phases have been estimated through the local stress acting on the cermet particles. This analysis indicates that creep behaviour of the Ni-8YSZ composite is not influenced by the metallic phase, but is controlled by the deformation of the 8YSZ matrix. It is also proposed that cermet creep mechanism involves Zr4+cations diffusion at the surface rather than in the bulk of the 8YSZ material. Impact of the Ni-8YSZ cermet creep on the internal stresses distribution in SOFC is discussed considering the anode supported cell (ASC) design. It is shown that cermet creep strain can induce a substantial stress decrease in the thin electrolyte. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The processing of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) often involves co-sintering of multi-layered stacks. In the case of SOFCs incorporating Ni-based anodes, hydrogen reduction of the anode usually takes place during the first service cycle of operation or conditioning. Initial reduction causes changes in the chemistry, microstructure and properties of the Ni-based anode material, which in turn induce mechanical stresses in the cell. In this study the elastic moduli, biaxial strength and fracture toughness of unreduced (NiO-YSZ) and reduced (Ni-YSZ) anode were determined as functions of porosity. Elastic properties were determined by impulse excitation at ambient temperature. Biaxial strength and fracture toughness were determined at ambient temperature by the ring-on-ring and double torsion test methods, respectively. It was found that the mechanical properties of unreduced and reduced Ni-based anode materials depend strongly on porosity. Property-porosity trends were found to be in good agreement with prediction of the minimum solid area model. Results presented in this study show that the elastic moduli and biaxial strength of the Ni-based anode material decreases after reduction in hydrogen while fracture toughness increases after reduction due to formation of ductile Ni-metal phase.

As general features, physicochemical properties and cell performance degradation/failure are correlated and bridged by the electrode reaction mechanisms. Particular emphasis is placed on the elemental behaviour of gaseous impurities and the possible role of liquids formed from gaseous substances. The lifetime of a state-of-the-art Ni cermet anodes is limited by a variety of microstructural changes, which mainly result from material transport-, deactivation- and thermomechanical mechanisms. Anode degradation can mainly be influenced by processing, conceptual and operating parameters. Designing a redox stable anode is currently one of the biggest challenges for small scale SOFC systems. Degradation mechanisms of different cathode materials are reviewed with a focus on the intrinsic degradation of doped lanthanum manganites (e.g. LSM) and doped lanthanum ferro-cobaltites (LSCF). Manganese-based perovskites can be regarded to be sufficiently stable, while for the better performing LSCF cathodes some intrinsic degradation was detected. New materials that are supposed to combine a better stability and high performance are also shortly mentioned. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The functionality of the cell is related to the structural integrity of the ceramic electrolyte, since its failure can lead to drastic performance losses. The mechanical property which is of most interest is the strength distribution at all relevant temperatures and how it is affected with time due to the environment. This study investigates the impact of the temperature on the strength and the fracture toughness of different zirconia electrolytes as well as the change of the elastic constants. 3YSZ and 6ScSZ materials are characterised regarding the influence of sub critical crack growth (SCCG) as one of the main lifetime limiting effects for ceramics at elevated temperatures. In addition, the reliability of different zirconia tapes is assessed with respect to temperature and SCCG. It was found that the strength is only influenced by temperature through the change in fracture toughness. SCCG has a large influence on the strength and the lifetime for intermediate temperature, while its impact becomes limited at temperatures higher than 650 °C. In this context the tetragonal 3YSZ and 6ScSZ behave quite different than the cubic 10Sc1CeSZ, so that at 850 °C it can be regarded as competitive compared to the tetragonal compounds.},

In this paper, we report the elastic behavior of three classical materials used in SOFCs as a function of temperature: Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) and Ni-YSZ. Both YSZ and LSM present unusual behaviors. The elastic modulus of YSZ first decreases slowly up to 150 °C, then dramatically up to 550 °C (certainly due to atomic motion) and finally increases probably because of an order-disorder transition (oxygen vacancies). The state of the art on zirconia was reviewed. For the LSM material, Young's modulus could not be determined below 600 °C. Above this temperature, samples with totally closed porosity present a continuously increasing modulus, while the other samples have a quite constant modulus. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For brittle failures, the probability distribution of structural strength and lifetime are known to be Weibullian, in which case the knowledge of the mean and standard deviation suffices to determine the loading or time corresponding to a tolerable failure probability such as 10(-6). Unfortunately, this is not so for quasibrittle structures, characterized by material inhomogeneities that are not negligible compared with the structure size (as is typical, e. g. for concrete, fibre composites, tough ceramics, rocks and sea ice). For such structures, the distribution of structural strength was shown to vary from almost Gaussian to Weibullian as a function of structure size (and also shape). Here we predict the size dependence of the distribution type for the lifetime of quasibrittle structures. To derive the lifetime statistics from the strength statistics, the subcritical crack growth law is requisite. This empirical law is shown to be justified by fracture mechanics of random crack jumps in the atomic lattice and the condition of equality of the energy dissipation rates calculated on the nano-scale and the macro-scale. The size effect on the lifetime is found to be much stronger than that on the structural strength. The theory is shown to match the experimentally observed systematic deviations of lifetime histograms from the Weibull distribution.},

abstract = {Solid electrolytes are increasingly being used in active electrochemical devices such as fuel cells and batteries. Several fuel cells or batteries are connected in series to form a stack or a battery pack. The present manuscript examines the phenomenon of degradation in such devices, whose origin lies in the very basics of local thermodynamic equilibrium and transport. The specific example of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is addressed here. If a single cell (or a few cells) in a stack exhibits higher resistance than the rest of the cells, stack failure often initiates at such a cell. The cell is then driven by, and exhibits lower voltage than the rest of the cells, and often even a negative voltage. The objective of this paper is to present a model for stack degradation when one of the cells exhibits a negative voltage. The existence of low level electronic conduction through the electrolyte plays central role in degradation. It is shown that if a cell exhibits a negative voltage, the oxygen chemical potential within the electrolyte can exceed that in the oxidant, and/or can drop below that in the fuel. This can lead to high internal oxygen partial pressure resulting in electrode cracking and delamination, and/or very low oxygen partial pressure leading to local electrolyte decomposition. Both situations can lead to cell and stack degradation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The effects of Ni-YSZ cermet re-oxidation in anode supported Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) have been investigated. Damage mechanisms have been studied in both cases of direct oxidation in air (i.e., fuel shutdown) or by an ionic current (i.e., fuel starvation). Direct oxidation tests show that the electrolyte cracks for a conversion degree of Ni into NiO ranging between ???58 and ???71{\%}. This failure mode has been modelled considering both the bulk expansion of the cermet induced by the transformation of the Ni phase and the change of mechanical stresses in the multilayered cell. In the case of fuel starvation, a thin layer of the cermet was electrochemically re-oxidised at 800 ??C and then reduced under a hydrogen stream. This 'redox' cycle was repeated until the degradation of the cell. The evolution of the impedance diagrams recorded after each cycle suggests that the cermet damages in an area close to anode/electrolyte interface. The mechanical modelling states that a delamination can occur along the interface between the Anode Functional Layer (AFL) and the Anode Current Collector (ACC) substrate. This theoretical result confirms the experimental trends observed by impedance spectroscopy. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The stress state and cell degradation have been modelled considering the classical solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) materials (Ni-YSZ//YSZ//LSM). The anode-supported cell is found to be un-cracked after its elaboration. However, the high level of energy stored in the thin electrolyte layer lowers the cell robustness as it constitutes the driving force for interfacial delamination. The elaboration of the electrolyte supported cell leads to the anode layer cracking. The heating up to 800 ??C and the cermet reduction allow relaxing the stress level in the cell. For the anode-supported cell, the cermet re-oxidation induces cathode damage as soon as the anodic strain exceeds 0.05-0.09{\%} whereas the electrolyte fracture occurs for strain ranging between 0.12{\%} and 0.15{\%}. For the electrolyte supported cell, the cermet re-oxidation induces a triggered risk of anode/electrolyte delamination when the anodic strain is higher than 0.3-0.35{\%}. The risk of rupture initiation in cell singularities has been also investigated. A pure material electrode/electrolyte singularity is harmless. A perpendicular corner at the electrode/electrolyte free edge constitutes a harmful singularity. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Zirconia tapes are established for the application as electrolytes in solid oxide fuel cells. One of their functional tasks is to provide the structural integrity of the cell. The mechanical failure of the electrolyte would cause leakage between the electrodes, leading to a reduction of the performance of a whole fuel cell stack. In order to assess the reliability of a certain zirconia tape with respect to a specific stress distribution and environment, the strength has to be properly characterised. In the present study a selection of several commercial highly ionic conductive scandia doped zirconia tapes was investigated regarding their strength under inert and humid conditions at room temperature, which required the determination of the elastic constants and the fracture toughness as well. The strength of the different zirconia tapes ranks according to their fracture toughness, while the strength distributions typically exhibit a Weibull modulus of m = 10. It was found that all tapes suffer from sub critical crack growth, which leads to a limited lifetime at a given static load and a drastic reduction of the room temperature strength at time scales relevant for actual operation.},

The present study investigates the failure mechanisms and the actual causes for fracture of electrolyte supported SOFCs which were run using the current ??-CHP system of Hexis AG, Winterthur - Switzerland under lab conditions or at customer sites for up to 40,000 h. In a first step several operated stacks were demounted for post-mortem inspection, followed by a fractographic evaluation of the failed cells. The respective findings are then set into a larger picture including an analysis of the present stresses acting on the cell like thermal and residual stresses and the measurements regarding the temperature dependent electrolyte strength. For all investigated stacks, the mechanical failure of individual cells can be attributed to locally acting bending loads, which rise due to an inhomogeneous and uneven contact between the metallic interconnect and the cell.?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Virkar2014,
abstract = {It is well known that many electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries, etc. degrade under various operating conditions. Many devices are based on solid electrolytes. In many cases, degradation manifests as electrode delamination and/or cracking of the electrolyte. An apparently obvious conclusion often reached is that this must be due to weak interfaces and some approach to mechanical strengthening or toughening should alleviate the problem. It is the intent of this manuscript to show that such electrochemical degradation often occurs due to electrochemical-mechanical coupling effects which result in extremely large internal pressures. So large can be the pressures that no amount conventional strengthening or toughening can prevent degradation. In fact, even a perfect lattice can be disrupted by electrochemically induced pressure leading to failures. In order to prevent failures, it is necessary to fully understand the role of coupling and develop strategies of mitigating high pressure formation by optimizing ion and electron transporting properties of the membrane. This manuscript discusses a fundamental mechanism of electrochemical failure of solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide electrolyzer cells, and oxygen separators based on oxygen ion conducting solid electrolytes. Experimental results on two types solid electrolyte cells are presented in support of the mechanism. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {The microstructural stability at elevated temperatures and the mechanical properties of 8 mol{\%} yttria stabilised zirconia (YSZ) has been investigated. The YSZ was supplied by two manufacturers as 150 $\mu$m thick sheet suitable for the electrolyte in a planar solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The two materials had the cubic structure and this crystal structure was maintained up to 1100°C, which was the highest temperature investigated. However, there were differences, albeit small in most cases, in composition, density, grain size and surface finish between the products from the two manufacturers. Although the compositional and structural variations resulted in some differences in mechanical performance, the general trends shown by both materials were similar. The strength, as determined by biaxial flexure, fell by 23–30{\%} on increasing the test temperature from room temperature (RT) to the SOFC operating temperature of 950°C and there was evidence for changes in crack initiation and propagation mechanisms at the higher temperature. The loading rate dependence of the RT strength yielded a low value for the stress exponent n in the standard lifetime equation, which indicated that sub-critical crack growth (sccg) was sensitive to applied stress. Constant load tests at 950–1000°C illustrated the sensitivity of sccg to stress and revealed that creep was also operative in this temperature range. It was concluded that the creep probably occurred by a grain boundary diffusion mechanism.},

@article{Afferrante2006,
abstract = {The Weibull distribution is widely used to describe the scatter of the strength in brittle (but also quasi-brittle) materials, often assuming that the Weibull modulus is a "material constant". One possible motivation of this perhaps comes from the classical Freudenthal's interpretation of Weibull modulus depending on the crack size distribution, which however assumes the cracks to be at large distance one from the other. It is here found with simple numerical experiments with collinear cracks that Weibull distributions tend to be obtained also with interaction taken into account, but the Weibull modulus depends on both the crack size distribution and the distribution of ligaments. Hence, Weibull modulus should not be considered a "material constant" or to correspond to an "intrinsic" microstructure of the material, as assumed in many industrial applications and commercial postprocessors of FEM softwares, even in the case of a varying stress fields. In the limit case of a crack or sharp notch this leads to paradoxically a zero scale parameter (and the usual Weibull modulus). Hence, in the case of a blunt notch, we suggest the Weibull modulus would vary depending on the distribution of cracks, their distances, and the interaction with the geometry and stress field. Only numerical simulations where the distribution of cracks is directly included in the geometry under consideration can provide the correct scale factor and Weibull modulus. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Understanding the electronic charge distribution around oxygen vacancies in transition metal and rare earth oxides is a scientific challenge of considerable technological importance. We show how significant information about the charge distribution around vacancies in cerium oxide can be gained from a study of high resolution crystal structures of higher order oxides which exhibit ordering of oxygen vacancies. Specifically, we consider the implications of a bond valence sum analysis of Ce 7 O 12 and Ce 11 O 20 . To illuminate our analysis we show alternative representations of the crystal structures in terms of orderly arrays of coordination defects and in terms of fluorite-type modules. We found that in Ce 7 O 12 , the excess charge resulting from removal of an oxygen atom delocalizes among all three triclinic Ce sites closest to the O vacancy. In Ce 11 O 20 , the charge localizes on the next nearest neighbour Ce atoms. Our main result is that the charge prefers to distribute itself so that it is farthest away from the O vacancies. This contradicts the standard picture of charge localization which assumes that each of the two excess electrons localizes on one of the cerium ions nearest to the vacancy. This standard picture is assumed in most calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Based on the known crystal structure of Pr 6 O 11 , we also predict that the charge in Ce 6 O 11 will be found in the second coordination shell of the O vacancy. We also extend the analysis to the Magn{\'{e}}li phases of titanium and vanadium oxides (M n O 2 n − 1 , where M = Ti, V) and consider the problem of metal–insulator transitions (MIT) in these oxides. We found that the bond valence analysis may provide a useful predictive tool in structures where the MIT is accompanied by significant changes in the metal–oxygen bond lengths. Although this review focuses mainly on bulk cerium oxides with some extension to the Magn{\'{e}}li phases of titanium and vanadium, our approach to characterizing electronic properties of oxygen vacancies and the physical insights gained should also be relevant to surface defects and to other rare earth and transition metal oxides.},

However, the linking of fuel cells (an energy conversion device) and hydrogen (an energy carrier) has emphasized investment in proton-exchange membrane fuel cells as part of a larger hydrogen economy and thus relegated fuel cells to a future technology. In contrast, solid oxide fuel cells are capable of operating on conventional fuels (as well as hydrogen) today. The main issue for solid oxide fuel cells is high operating temperature (about 800 degrees C) and the resulting materials and cost limitations and operating complexities (e.g., thermal cycling). Recent solid oxide fuel cells results have demonstrated extremely high power densities of about 2 watts per square centimeter at 650 degrees C along with flexible fueling, thus enabling higher efficiency within the current fuel infrastructure. Newly developed, high-conductivity electrolytes and nanostructured electrode designs provide a path for further performance improvement at much lower temperatures, down to {\~{}}350 degrees C, thus providing opportunity to transform the way we convert and store energy.},
