\section{Introduction}
    \gls{sfcm} is a new material that is of particular interest because of its high conductivity and stability in hydrocarbon fuels.\cite{Pan}
    SFCM takes advantage of the perovskite structure and multivalent cations similar to \gls{smm}, but the combination of both Fe and Co further increase the conductivity of the material.
    It has been shown that an SOFC using SFCM as an anode support material is redox stable up to 30 cycles at \temp{600} between H\textsubscript{2}/3\%H\textsubscript{2}O and nitrogen.\cite{Hussaina,Hussain}

    This work expands upon the fundamental knowledge of SFCM and aims to understand the defect chemistry which leads to its high conductivity as an \gls{miec}.
    \Gls{xrd} and Rietveld refinement show the phase stability and lattice parameter changes of SFCM across \glspl{po2}.
    Electrical conductivity is measured as a function of \po2{} to determine changes electrical conductivity types.
    \Gls{tpd} spectroscopy was used to characterize the oxygen desorption as it occurs from the lattice.
    The non-stoichiometry of \gls{sfcm} was measured under oxidizing and reducing environments at various temperatures via thermogravimetric analysis and a defect equilibrium model and diagram is proposed from the data with results compared to \gls{smm} and other perovskite materials.

\section{Results and Discussion}
    \subsection{Phase purity and chemical expansion}
    The \gls{xrd} patterns obtained after reduction in 1.9\% H\textsubscript{2}, 2.9\% H\textsubscript{2}O at \temp{600} and oxidation in pure oxygen at \temp{600}, in addition to the fresh as synthesized powder and the pattern obtained from Rietveld refinement, are presented in Figure \ref{fig:structure}a.
    A tetragonal, unordered B-site, double perovskite structure was used as a starting point for Rietveld refinement based on the structures of \ce{Sr_2CoMoO_6}, \ce{Sr_2NiMoO_6} and \ce{Sr_2Fe_{0.75}Co_{0.25}MoO_6}.\cite{Huang2009,Ritter2004}
    Results from the Rietveld refinement calculations are given in Table \ref{tab:xrdrefine}.
    The refined unit cell is presented in Figure \ref{fig:structure}b and was used to create the theoretical \gls{xrd} pattern for comparison.

    SFCM proved to be stable under reducing conditions, being pure phase based on the Rietveld refinement.
    Overall phase purity remains at greater than 76\% as synthesized, 85\% under oxidizing conditions and at 100\% after reduction.
    \ce{Sr_2Co_{1.2}Mo_{0.8}O_6} was found in SFCM under ambient and oxidizing conditions.
    This secondary phase reversibly disappears when returning to reducing conditions after oxidation.

    Changes in SFCM's lattice parameters are attributed to the oxidation states of the B-site cations and the concentration of vacancies in the sample after exposure to different \po2{}s.
    Reduction of SFCM from an as synthesized state causes a 0.025\% decrease in $a$ and the volume of the unit cell and a 0.025\% increase in $c$.
    These are the result of the bond lengths between strontium and oxygen in site 2 (Sr-O2) and the distance between metal site 2 and oxygen site 1 (M2-O1) decreasing. %don't like the way I did this
    %These are result of the bond lengths between Sr-O2 and M2-O1 decreasing, where is the species at a unique site. %don't like the way I did this
    Oxidizing the SFCM results in a 0.14\% increase in $a$ and a 0.16\% increase in $c$ resulting an 0.44\% increase in cell volume.
    This is the result of all bond lengths increasing by \SI{0.002} to \SI{0.004}{\angstrom}.
    These small lattice parameter shifts are in line with the general nature of perovskites to display little to no change due to chemical expansion.\cite{Bishop2014}
    Additionally, when changes do occur, perovskites have been shown to have anisotropic chemical expansion, as such with \gls{sfm} where $a$ increases upon reduction while $c$ decreases.\cite{Tsvetkov2016}
    In summary, SFCM shows very little change to lattice parameters as a result of changing metal oxidation states or vacancy creation as it under goes reduction or oxidation.

    \subsection{Conductivity}
    SFCM has a conductivity dependence typical of \gls{miec} conductors, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:conductivity}.
    At high \po2{} ranges (\SI{e-1.5}{atm} to \SI{1}{atm}) it shows p-type conductivity, where conductivity increases with \po2{}.
    Down to \SI{e-1}{atm}, the change in conductivity is linear with a slope of \SI{0.089} (log-log scale).
    Below \SI{e-1}{atm} the slope changes away from the previous trend, suggesting a change in the predominant charge carrier.
    At low \po2{} ranges (\SI{e-24}{atm} to \SI{e-19}{atm}) the conductivity behaves linearly with n-type conductivity, increasing at lower \po2{}, with a slope of \SI{-0.11} (log-log scale).
    The sample measured in this work exhibited a lower conductivity than that reported in previous work (\SI{2}{S\per\centi\meter} compared to \SI{30}{S\per\centi\meter} at \temp{600}).\cite{Pan}
    This difference is likely due to sample preparation creating additional porosity, reducing the absolute conductivity, but the trend with \po2{} remains consistent.
    %Due to the inability to measure the intermediate \po2{} we were unable to determine in this work at what point the \po2{} dependence changes from n-type to p-type and if there is an ionic regime in between.

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{conductivity.jpg}
      \caption{Total conductivity as \po2{} changes under a) reducing and b)oxidizing conditions at \SI{600}{\celsius}.}
      \label{fig:conductivity}
    \end{figure}

    Based on the slopes in the high \po2{} region, at least two defect regimes exist in that area transitioning near \SI{e-1}{atm}.
    Both high and low \po2{} regions have slopes much lower than +1/4 or -1/4 respectively, which indicates that the relationship between electronic charge carriers and oxygen is dependent of the other defect species in the material.
    In fact, the lower than 1/4 slope suggests that the electronic charge carries are taken up by the other species, decreasing the expected number based on \po2{} change.
    At low \po2{}, n-type conductivity is promoted by the generation of oxygen vacancies, freeing electrons as negative electronic charge carriers to maintain charge balance.
    Some of these electrons are consumed by the reduction of B-site metals to lower oxidation states.
    At high \po2{}, oxygen vacancies are filled and B-site metals oxidize, consuming electrons and allowing for the creation of holes, promoting p-type conductivity.
    The different slopes between high and low \po2{} are the result of different defect species interacting with the electronic carriers at different points in the reduction.

    \subsection{Temperature programed desorption}
    \Gls{tpd} was performed in conjunction with \gls{tga} to determine the extent of oxygen desorption from \gls{sfcm}.
    Figure \ref{fig:TPD} presents the data from the \gls{tga} on top with the mass and rate of mass change, while the \SI{32}{m\per z} signal from oxygen in the mass spectrometer is on bottom.
    The cyclic noise present in both mass and \gls{ms} signals is due to temperature fluctuations as a result of an improperly tuned PID controller on the \gls{tga} furnace, but the noise remained much lower than the measured signal.
    The rate of mass loss matches the oxygen signal from the \gls{ms}, confirming that oxygen is generated from \gls{sfcm} when heated under N\textsubscript{2} and is the cause for mass loss in the sample.
    \gls{sfcm} shows two maxima for the rate of oxygen loss during heating.
    The first, \textalpha, occurs at \temp{405} with the second peak, \textbeta, occurring near \temp{800}.
    The \gls{ms} monitored for other species, such as carbon and water, but no significant amounts were observed.

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TPD.jpg}
      \caption{Temperature programmed desorption of oxygen in SFCM with mass loss from TGA (top) and oxygen desorption from \gls{ms} (bottom) as it is heated to \SI{800}{\celsius} in N\textsubscript{2}}
      \label{fig:TPD}
    \end{figure}

    Perovskite materials have oxygen desorption classified based on the temperature at which it occurs.
    Low temperature desorption (referred to as \textalpha{}), occurs due to the reduction of metals and desorption of oxygen near the surface.
    High temperature desorption (referred to as \textbeta{}), takes place when oxygen is able to diffuse through the bulk and be released.\cite{Levasseur2009}
    SFCM shows both \textalpha{} and \textbeta{} desorption, indicating that both the surface and lattice can generate oxygen vacancies due to the reduction of the different B-site cations and that those vacancies are mobile to move from the bulk to the surface.
    \gls{smm} shows only \textbeta{} desorption above \temp{800}, while \gls{sfm} has \textalpha{} desorption from \temp{400} to \temp{800} and \gls{scm} desorbs starting below \temp{400}.\cite{Liu2011, Vasala2010}
    In the case of \gls{sfm} and \gls{scm}, the use of the multivalent Fe or Co allows for reduction at a lower temperature than \gls{smm}.
    For SFCM, the same effect is seen through the combined use of Fe and Co.
    This demonstrates SFCM's ability to begin to create oxygen vacancies at \temp{400} and exchange oxygen with the bulk lattice starting as low as \temp{450} and peaking near \temp{800}.

    \subsection{Oxygen non-stoichiometry}
    Oxygen non-stoichiometry and oxygen vacancy concentrations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:TGA600} at \temp{600} for high and low \po2{} regions.
    At high \po2{}, SFCM has two linear regions, changing between them near \SI{e-0.75}{atm}.
    The transition between regions in oxygen stoichiometry occurs at a similar \po2{} to where the conductivity changes in Figure \ref{fig:conductivity}.
    This change is the result of a change in defect regime regions.
    In the low \po2{} region, a linear trend occurs down until \SI{e-21}{atm} where the non-stoichiometry rate increases.
    Due to the pure phase \gls{xrd} under reducing conditions, it is not likely that the increase in non-stoichiometry is due to phase decomposition and instead is a change in regimes where more oxygen vacancies are present.

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{TGA600.jpg}
      \caption{Non-stoichiometry (top) and corresponding oxygen vacancy concentration (bottom) of SFCM under oxidizing conditions (right) and reducing conditions (left) at \SI{600}{\celsius}}
      \label{fig:TGA600}
    \end{figure}

    SFCM shows similar trends in non-stoichiometry to \gls{smm} and \gls{sfm}, but with the added complexity expected from the additional B-site species.
    \gls{smm} approaches a plateau in oxygen content as it reached \SI{1}{atm} of oxygen the same as SFCM but possesses a constant slope of -1/6 when plotted on a log-log scale.\cite{Marrero-lopez2010}
    In comparison, SFCM has multiple slopes associated with the degree of vacancy formation, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:TGA600}c and \ref{fig:TGA600}d.
    These different slopes can be attributed to the reduction of the three different B-site cations at different \po2{}.
    As an oxygen vacancy forms, the electrons required to maintain charge balance can be accommodated by the reduction of Fe, Co, or Mo, each with an independent equilibrium constant, whereas \gls{smm} only has Mo reduction to accommodate electrons from oxygen vacancy generation.
    The high slopes of Figure \ref{fig:TGA600}d show how SFCM can generate more oxygen vacancies at lower \po2{} because of the Fe and Co cations.
    \gls{sfm} and \gls{smm} show similar amounts of non-stoichiometry at the same \po2{} but at \temp{1000}.\cite{Kircheisen2012}
    SFCM shows almost twice the non-stoichiometry at a much lower temperature of \temp{600}.
    SFCM's ability to create vacancies at higher \po2{} results in a larger accumulated vacancy concentration at low \po2{}.

    TGA non-stoichiometry measurements were performed on the same sample at \temp{400},  \temp{500}, and \temp{600} which are in the low temperature-SOFC range.
    Figure \ref{fig:TGAtemps} shows the non-stoichiometry measurements for the sample  tested at three temperatures in the low \po2{} (a) and high \po2{} (b) regions.
    As expected, lowering the temperature reduces the non-stoichiometry at a given \po2{} and decreases the \po2{} at which transitions between regimes occur.
    At \temp{400}, oxygen vacancy formation decreases considerably compared to \temp{500} and \temp{600}
    This aligns with the results of the TPD (Figure \ref{fig:TPD}) where SFCM does not start desorbing oxygen until \temp{350} to \temp{400}, and then only from the surface.

      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{TGAtemps.jpg}
      \caption{Non-stoichiometry of SFCM as \po2{} changes at \SI{400}{\celsius}, \SI{500}{\celsius}, and \SI{600}{\celsius}}
      \label{fig:TGAtemps}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Defect equilibrium model and diagram}
    To best understand what is occurring in SFCM, a defect equilibrium diagram and model need to be created to relate the changes in conductivity and non-stoichiometry to the concentration of the various defects present in the material.
    Defect reactions with their corresponding equilibrium equations are given in Equations \ref{rxn:intrinsic}{--}\ref{rxn:metalred}, which use Kr\"oger–Vink notation, where a species is denoted by the site it sits on (subscript) and the relative charge to the site's expected valency (superscript).
    For example, $\ch{V_O^{**}}$ is a vacancy in an oxygen site with a 2+ charge and $\ch{B_B^'}$ is a B-site metal in a B-site with a 1$-$ charge.
    K represents the equilibrium, or mass-action, constant for the reaction.
    To simplify the set of equations, Equation \ref{rxn:metalred} represents the combined reduction of any B-site cation (Fe, Co, or Mo).
    \textbeta{} is the ratio of A-site vacancies to B-site vacancies from Schottky defects.
    \begin{align}
        \label{rxn:intrinsic}
        \emptyset& \ch{<-> e' + h^{*}}&   K_i&  = np\\
        \label{rxn:schottky}
        \emptyset& \ch{<->  3 V_O^{**} + V_A^{''} + V_B^{''''}}& K_s& = \lbrack\ch{V_O^{**}}\rbrack^3 \lbrack\ch{V_A^{''}}\rbrack \lbrack\ch{V_B^{''''}}\rbrack = \lbrack\ch{V_O^{**}}\rbrack^3 \lbrack\ch{V_B^{''''}}\rbrack ^{\beta + 1}\\
        \label{rxn:external}
        \ch{O_O^x}& \ch{<-> 1/2 O2 + V_O^{**} + 2 e'}& K_r& = p_{O_2}^{1/2} \lbrack\ch{V_O^{**}}\rbrack n^2\\
        \label{rxn:metalred}
        \ch{B_B^x + e^'}& \ch{<-> B_B^'}& K_{B}& = \lbrack\ch{B_B^{'}}\rbrack n^{-1}
    \end{align}

    The Duncan-Wachsman approach allows for the accurate solution of defect equations across \po2{} regions using dominant defect triads, compared to the dominant defect pairs of the Brouwer approach which lead to inaccurate results near transition regions.\cite{Duncan2007}
    The Duncan-Wachsman approach is needed in this work to model the defect equilibria because the measured \po2{} range crosses various Brouwer regions, as indicated by the non-linearity of Figure \ref{fig:TGA600}c.
    Using this method, Equations \ref{rxn:intrinsic}{--}\ref{rxn:metalred} can be solved to give models of the defect concentrations across \po2s.
    Due to the fact that impurity phases form under oxidizing conditions, only the pure phase, reducing \po2s were solved for.
    Table \ref{tab:defectequ} gives the resulting equations from the Duncan-Wachsman approach for the defect concentrations at these \po2{}.
    To allow for the solution of the equations, it was assumed that all B-site metals will have already reduced to their maximum potential, that is $\lbrack\ch{B_B^'}\rbrack$ is constant, in the \po2{} range of interest.

    Using the TGA and conductivity data with the equations given in Table \ref{tab:defectequ}, the reaction equilibrium constants can be fitted to obtain a general defect equilibrium diagram for reducing \po2s as shown in Figure \ref{fig:defects}a.
    The electron mobility was calculated from the fitted data at \temp{600} to be \SI{0.0408}{\centi\meter\squared\per\volt\per\second}, which is within the range for small polaron defects for \gls{smm}.\cite{Marrero-lopez2010}
    By fitting and plotting the values of K\textsubscript{r} from various temperatures (Figure \ref{fig:defects}b), the enthalpy of formation for oxygen vacancies was found to be \SI{39.1}{\kilo\joule\per\mol} in SFCM under reducing conditions.

    \begin{figure}
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{defect.jpg}
      \caption{Oxygen vacancy and electronic defects in SFCM based on conductivity and TGA non-stoichiometry}
      \label{fig:defects}
    \end{figure}

    While the fit for the oxygen vacancy concentration in Figure \ref{fig:defects}a fits well, the model predicts a steeper slope for the concentration of electrons.
    The cause of this is from the assumption that $\lbrack\ch{B_B^'}\rbrack$ is a constant, made while solving the defect reaction equations.
    In reality, while most B-site metals will have reduced, a portion will still be reducing at the low \po2{}, decreasing the overall number of conduction electrons, and reducing the \po2{} dependence of n.
    At low \po2{} both the concentrations of electrons and oxygen vacancies are on the same order of magnitude promoting mixed conduction.
    SFCM has an enthalpy of formation lower than that of comparable materials.
    \gls{sfm} and \gls{smm} have much higher enthalpies of \SI{253}{\kilo\joule\per\mol} and \SI{110}{\kilo\joule\per\mol} respectively.\cite{Kircheisen2012,Marrero-lopez2010}
    \ce{SrFeO_{$3-\delta$}} has a more comparable, but still greater, enthalpy of \SI{80}{\kilo\joule\per\mol}.\cite{Holt1999}
    This low enthalpy of formation of oxygen vacancies in SFCM allows for a greater range of non-stoichiometry and thus SFCM's high performance.


\section{Conclusions}
    SFCM has potential as an electrode material in a number of electrochemical device applications.
    Specifically, it has a potential to replace nickel-based anodes in SOFCs due to its high conductivity and redox stability, creating an all-ceramic anode.
    SFCM forms impurity phases when heated at \temp{600} under oxidizing environments but becomes pure phase with reduction.
    It also exhibits very small chemical expansion with changing \po2{}, in line with its perovskite structure.
    SFCM is an improvement over previous double perovskite materials because of high conductivity at temperatures below \temp{600}.
    This is in part because SFCM supports the formation of oxygen vacancies at both surface and lattice positions shown by overlapping \textalpha{} and \textbeta{} oxygen desorption, starting as low at \temp{350} and continuing up until above \temp{800}.
    Oxygen vacancies form more rapidly than other \gls{miec} materials with decreasing \po2{} as combination of B-site cations enables reduction though a large range of \po2{} resulting in a low enthalpy of formation for oxygen vacancies at \SI{39.1}{\kilo\joule\per\mol}.
    Proposed defect equilibrium equations were given for the low \po2{} range and are supported by thermogravimetric and conductivity measurements for the complex system.
    Thermogravimetry at lower temperatures demonstrated SFCM's activity until \temp{400} at which the amount of oxygen vacancy formation slows dramatically.
